      "Homo sapiens survived the rigors of the African savannah and migrated to the rest of the globe because of the capacity and the need to move. We evolved as a nomadic species that lived by cunning and mobility, not by specialized skills and tools of the predator or by the herd behavior and acceleration of the herbivore. Movement, to gather and hunt through the day and to spread far and wide over longer time scales, has helped define who and what we are.Even when we abandoned our gatherer-hunter lifestyle for the settled agricultural life, we moved - to plant, to weed, to reap, to protect the crops, to defend the village. The industrial laborer and the miner, like the agricultural laborer, earned their bread by the sweat of their brows. Only in the last hundred years has a significant proportion of humanity - and it is a greater proportion every day - ceased to move to earn a wage.There is a price to pay: with lack of physical activity comes obesity, particularly when accompanied by a remarkable abundance of food and the insatiable desire of the food manufacturers to push ever increasing consumption. With obesity come the diseases that we used to think of as the diseases of affluence. However, these increasingly afflict the urban poor in the developed and developing world; they are better thought of as the diseases of inertia.Mostly we think of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this context, but it is increasingly clear that cancer is also a disease of inertia. In this book, a broadly multidisciplinary group presents the evidence and provides the recommendations.\n",

      "Many clinicians, researchers, and lay public associate an expanding waistline and a couch-potato lifestyle with increased tendency to develop cardiovascular disease and some of its risk factors . These lifestyle factors, however, also play into the etiology and prognosis of several types of cancers, which is important in the clinical and public health areas. It is important to public health because cancer is a common disease and overweight or obesity and sedentary behavior are extremely common and becoming more so . It is important to medicine because a marked increase in a consistent risk factor will mean an increase in number of cancer cases unless some other widespread prevention factor negates this effect.In addition, the implications for poorer prognosis in affected individuals means that treating oncologists and other health care providers will need to develop new and better therapies to deal with the declining prognosis in this large segment of the population. Clinicians should be aware that, because two thirds of the American population is overweight or obese and being overweight increases risk for cancer, the vast majority of cancers in the future will occur in overweight and obese individuals.The association between obesity and a sedentary lifestyle with risk for cancer has been appreciated for several decades. Only in the past 10 years or so, however, has the strength and consistency of this association been apparent. This is largely due to two things: the increase in prevalence in overweight, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles; and an increase in the number of epidemiological studies focusing on these associations.The American Cancer Society estimates that a third of all cancer deaths could be prevented through avoidance of obesity and sedentary lifestyles. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that 25 to 30% of several cancers could be prevented if individuals avoided lifetime weight gain and obesity and participated in regular physical activity. These same organizations and several clinical groups are now recognizing the important role that physical activity can play in improving quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. This area is new, so there is great need for a definitive textbook that provides the scientific background and evidence supporting these relationships, as well as clinical guidelines for bringing physical activity and weight control into cancer prevention and treatment practices throughout the world.We are very fortunate to have a world-class roster of authors for this text. The chapter authors have been chosen because they are the top researchers in the field of obesity, physical activity, and cancer.Section I focuses on the research methods used in assessing the associations between physical activity, energy balance, and cancer risk and prognosis. Observational epidemiological studies can provide important information about relationships among these variables. More definitive evidence of the effect of changing behaviors, with resulting change in level of adiposity and amount of energy expended, is provided through randomized clinical trials. Dr. Prentice, principal investigator of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Coordinating Center and a world expert on nutrition and cancer describes the benefits and drawbacks of each of these study design methods.The measurement of energy balance and physical activity are far from straightforward. Energy balance involves the interplay among energy intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic rate. Genetic, age, and gender factors also play an important role. Defining what exactly energy balance is and what aspects of excessive adiposity are most pertinent to cancer and determining how much physical activity a person is actually doing are all great challenges requiring the concerted input of measurement experts. Drs. Ainsworth and Coleman present the intricacies of exercise and physical activity measurement, and Dr. Irwin describes the pluses and minuses of the many ways of assessing body composition.The role of physical activity in the incidence of individual cancers is the focus of Section II. In a comprehensive literature review, Drs. Patel and Bernstein write about the intriguing data pointing to a role of exercise and physical activity in reducing risk for breast cancer. They compare and contrast the types of epidemiological studies and the role of exercise and physical activity in premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. The many studies on exercise, physical activity, and colon cancer are reviewed by Dr. Slattery, who summarizes how exercise plays a role in colon cancer etiology. She also reviews the evidence regarding the association between physical activity and rectal cancer occurrence. Dr. Friedenreich elegantly summarizes the state of knowledge on the associations between exercise and prostate cancer risk, pointing out why the associations are not yet firm and suggesting future research pathways.Section III focuses on mechanisms that may explain the inverse association between physical activity and incidence of several cancers. Dr. McTiernan reviews the effect of exercise on sex hormones, which has relevance for several hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and prostate. Dr. Frank reviews the role of exercise in reducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; insulin has been shown to promote tumor cells in vitro, and persons with high insulin levels have increased risk for some cancers and reduced prognosis once diagnosed with breast cancer. Ms. Wetmore and Dr. Ulrich review the literature on the complicated associations between physical activity and several markers of immune function, especially ones that may be relevant to cancer occurrence or prognosis. Dr. Martinez describes the effect of exercise on prostaglandins, which may in part explain the consistent findings of reduced colon cancer risk among active, compared with sedentary, persons. Drs. Thompson, Jiang, and Zhu describe the animal model research that has defined the role of excess adiposity and of energy restriction on tumorogenesis. The current state of human intervention studies on physical activity and cancer biomarkers is presented by Dr. McTiernan. Dr. Rankinen reviews the intriguing new field of genetics, physical activity, and cancer, which may help to define persons who may be helped with activity in terms of cancer risk.Section IV focuses on the breadth and depth of knowledge on the effect of overweight and obesity on cancer incidence. Dr. Ballard-Barbash presents the state of knowledge regarding the effects of weight, adiposity, lifetime weight change, and risk of breast cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Drs. Kaaks and Lukanova present similar information for the effect of increasing adiposity on the development of endometrial cancer. Drs. Michaud and Giovannucci present the emerging data linking increased adiposity with increased risk for pancreatic cancer. The new and increasing body of knowledge regarding the effect of obesity on esophageal cancer is presented by Drs. Hoyo and Gammon. Dr. Slattery reviews the role of overweight and obesity in the etiology of colon cancer.Section V reviews the mechanisms that might explain the association between adiposity and incidence of several cancers. Drs. Kaaks and McTiernan describe the role of adipose tissue in the production and metabolism of sex hormones, which is important for several hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and prostate cancers. Dr. Blackburn presents the state of knowledge regarding obesity and insulin resistance, taking from the extensive depth of information available from diabetic research results. Drs. Priest and Church present data on the effect of adiposity on cytokines and inflammatory markers that may have particular relevance for cancer. The important role of animal studies in shedding light on the effect of exercise on biology related to cancer formation is described in depth by Dr. Colbert. Drs. Tworoger and McGrath present the emerging body of literature on the genetics of obesity as it pertains to cancer incidence.Section VI concentrates on the importance of physical activity on aspects of quality of life and prognosis for many cancer patients. Dr. Winters-Stone describes the studies that have examined the effect of exercise and physical activity on fatigue in breast cancer patients and survivors. Dr. Courneya, Ms. Campbell, Ms. Karvinen, and Ms. Ladha describe studies that have explored the effect of exercise on quality of life in colon and other cancer patients. Drs. Abrahamson and Gammon describe the emerging information on the role of physical activity in cancer prognosis and suggest biological mechanisms that might explain the association.Section VII presents information on the role of overweight and obesity on prognosis of several cancers. Dr. Goodwin reviews the many studies that have examined the effect of adiposity on breast cancer recurrence and survival and presents suggested mechanisms for such relationships. Dr. Rock presents results of recent studies pointing to a role of adiposity on survival and recurrence in patients with colon, prostate, and other cancers.The final section, Section VIII, gives the reader clues to how the information presented in the rest of the book might be implemented at the individual, clinical, and public health levels. Dr. Fogelholm writes on the use of exercise and physical activity in weight control at the individual level. Dr. Heber and Ms. Bowerman provide information on dietary and other methods of energy balance for overweight and obese persons. Dr. Bull describes population-level initiatives to increase physical activity in population settings. Dr. Pronk provides insight into disseminating exercise and diet interventions into the primary care setting. Drs. Schwartz and Winters-Stone provide advice on initiating and maintaining increased exercise and physical activity in cancer patients and survivors. Finally, Drs. Chlebowski, Geller, Harvie and Howell provide guidance on incorporating exercise and diet recommendations into clinical oncology practice.We hope that this volume provides a comprehensive review of the roles of energy balance, physical activity, and cancer incidence and prognosis. The epidemic of overweight and obesity and the increasing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles will have an impact on the magnitude and quality of the cancer problem around the globe. Viewed differently, knowing that energy balance is so important to the risk and prognosis from cancer may be an important incentive for the general public, persons at high risk, and cancer patients and survivors to increase physical activity, reduce excess weight, and maintain energy balance lifelong.\n",

      "This chapter is concerned with the strengths and weaknesses of, and the role played by, major observational and interventional study designs in cancer prevention through exercise and weight control research agenda. Because the research study design issues tend to be similar for the prevention of cancer and for other major chronic diseases, the discussion is broadened to the role of these study designs in chronic disease prevention. Also, issues related to physical activity assessment have much in common with those for dietary assessment, and energy balance is central to weight control, so the discussion also highlights issues arising in the study of diet and nutrition and chronic disease prevention.A major goal of a research program aimed at weight control and chronic disease prevention is the development of evidence-based preventative recommendations for the general population and for its major subgroups, along with the development of practical approaches to satisfying such recommendations. Pharmaceutical approaches also have a role among chronic disease prevention tools for persons for whom behavioral strategies may be insufficient. In either case, preventative recommendations need to have an overriding focus on overall health benefits vs. risks, with important implications for research designs and emphases.From the obesity epidemic in the United States and other Western countries, and from the strong associations between overweight and obesity and the incidence and mortality from cancer and other chronic diseases, it seems evident that Western societies are suffering a tremendous disease burden owing to unfavorable physical activity and dietary consumption patterns. However, available recommendations concerning the amount and type of physical activity and nutrient consumption and dietary patterns have been only modestly influenced by chronic disease prevention considerations, because of limitations in available research data. Related to this, research that aims to develop and test behavioral interventions and strategies for improving physical activity and dietary patterns for individuals or communities tends to be hampered by a lack of consensus on desirable intervention goals.Indeed, the development of practical physical activity and dietary recommendations that may help to reverse overweight, obesity, and chronic disease trends is a most challenging research aim, though many opportunities are currently available. The obvious epidemiological approach to gaining the requisite knowledge involves comparing persons with various physical activity and dietary patterns in respect to subsequent weight changes and chronic disease event rates. In fact, cohort studies, along with other observational designs, do constitute a mannstay approach in exercise and nutritional epidemiology. However, epidemiological research on these patterns is attended by some important issues that can cast aspersions on the reliability and interpretation of reported associations.\n",

      "The first issue concerning the reliability and interpretation of observational studies in these areas is classical epidemiological confounding. For example, persons sustaining a high level of physical activity over much of their lifespan may differ in many biobehavioral respects from more sedentary persons. These may, for example, include socioeconomic factors, skill level in sports, aspects of physical functioning and emotional status, and dietary habits. Insofar as these factors also relate to weight maintenance and chronic disease risk, they need to be recognized, accurately measured, and properly included in data analysis to avoid confounding. In fact, such comprehensive confounding control is rarely practical, so there is always some uncertainty, for example, as to whether a reported association of a physical activity pattern with a chronic disease risk is attributable in part to corresponding uncontrolled differences in diet or other potential confounding factors.Very similar confounding issues attend dietary patterns, with physical activity as an important potential confounder. Additionally, studies aimed at elucidating the relationship of the consumption of specific nutrients or foods to chronic disease risk need to acknowledge potential confounding by other nutrients and food that may be highly correlated with those under investigation.\n",

      "An equally important issue in physical activity and dietary epidemiology concerns \"exposure\" assessment. Physical activity is typically self-reported by means of records, logs, or recalls. The instruments used may have demonstrated some degree of repeatability in populations of interest, but the accuracy, and measurement properties more generally, are usually unknown. Alternatively, physical activity is sometimes indirectly assessed using physiological methods. For example, measures of cardiopulmonary fitness, such as maximum oxygen output volume, have been used to produce estimates of normal physical activity , although such measures may be insensitive to low-intensity or longer term activity levels.Most observational studies, however, rely on self-reported physical activity assessments obtained using personal interviews or mailed questionnaires that ask the respondent to recall historic information; this is used to construct physical activity estimates over time. Clearly, such physical activity estimates may include substantial measurement error. Statistical approaches to accommodating such measurement error almost universally assume a classical measurement model in which the assessment, Z, relates to the targeted actual physical activity, X , viawhere the measurement error term e is assumed to be statistically independent of X and independent of other study subject characteristics and confounding factors.Unfortunately, these methods will generally not yield accurate estimates of association between physical activity and disease risk if a more complex measurement model is required. For example, if overweight or obese persons tend to perceive and report physical activity differently than do normal or underweight persons, biased associations can be expected. Similarly, if physical activity reporting depends on age, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, social desirability factors, or dietary patterns, bias can be expected to the extent that these factors are related to the outcomes under study.Note that this issue of systematic bias in physical activity assessment is quite distinct from the confounding issue cited previously. For example, suppose that, in a cohort study of physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk, overweight women tend to report greater physical activity than leaner women, although their actual physical activity tends to be somewhat less. Such systematic bias in assessment will distort and may even reverse the direction of the estimated physical activity and disease risk association. The inclusion of an indicator variable for overweight in a regression analysis of breast cancer risk, which may be considered to prevent confounding, cannot be expected to resolve the distortion caused by systematic bias in physical activity assessment.The use of objective measures of physical activity, at least in a subset of the study cohort, provides potential to avoid major biases due to measurement error. An objective measure is one in which the measurement error is independent of study subject characteristics or other confounding factors. For example, the maximum oxygen output volume previously mentioned may plausibly satisfy this criterion. Additionally, the objective measure should adhere to the classical measurement model so that the assessment measures the targeted quantity, X, aside from random error. This may be a difficult criterion to satisfy because potential objective measures of physical activity may often be insensitive, incomplete, or variable over time in their response to specific physical activity patterns.The doubly labeled water measure of energy expenditure provides a valuable tool for objectively measuring physical activity. The rates of recovery of two nonradioactive isotopes in urine, following bolus consumption in the form of doubly labeled water, allows carbon dioxide production, and thus energy expenditure, to be estimated accurately over a short-term period. Subtraction of basal metabolic energy expenditure, as determined by indirect calorimetry, yields an assessment of physical activity-related energy expenditure that plausibly adheres to Equation 1.1 as an estimate of actual energy expenditure. The costs of this approach are such that it is not a practical approach for all members of a study cohort, which typically includes tens of thousands of study subjects if rare diseases are under study. Rather, such a procedure can only be applied to a modest subset of cohort members. The relationship between the objective measure and self-report measures can then be used to calibrate the self-report measures on the remainder of the cohort, and the calibrated values play a fundamental role in analyses to associate physical activity-related energy expenditure to disease risk.To date, the doubly labeled water method has evidently not been used in large epidemiological cohort studies of physical activity, at least not on the scale required for the calibration procedure just mentioned. The doubly labeled water measure has received greater use, however, in nutritional epidemiology, in which the estimate of energy expenditure can reasonably be equated to short-term energy consumption among weight-stable persons. For example, the National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study used the doubly labeled water method, along with urinary nitrogen , as an objective recovery measure of protein consumption among 484 men and women aged 40 to 69; this project studied the structure of measurement error in commonly used dietary self-report instruments, including a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall.A Nutrient Biomarker Study among 544 women is currently nearing completion within the dietary modification component of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial among nearly 48,835 postmenopausal women . In that context, energy consumption, X, will be related to disease risk using the measurement model, Equation 1.1, for the doubly labeled water measure, Z, along with the measurement model :for the food frequency energy consumption estimate W, where V represents factors such as obesity, age, or ethnicity that may affect how a person reports dietary consumption, the term X®V allows the influence of these factors on reporting to depend on actual consumption X, r represents a personspecific bias term, u represents random error, and all variates on the right side of Equation 1.1 and Equation 1.2 are assumed to be statistically independent.\n",

      "Document 63:\n",
      "In addition to the avoidance of confounding, and the need for a suitable measurement error model, observational studies of physical activity and diet in relation to chronic disease risk require the selection of representative study subjects from the target population and outcome ascertainment that is unrelated to study exposures. It is reasonable to ask how related potential sources of bias should affect one's evaluation and interpretation of the reliability of observational study reports describing associations, or lack thereof, between some aspect of exercise and diet and the risk of a chronic disease. In fact, the many ways to present measures of these exposures and to slice exposure ranges tend to reduce study reliability unless the authors have adhered to a prespecified analysis plan.The overall question of study reliability is, however, often difficult to answer. The discussion section of observational study reports often runs down a list of potential biases, and the authors give their opinions as to why each bias is not expected to be of importance. Indeed, decades of intensive risk factor studies using cohort or case-control designs for a number of chronic diseases, along with the development of corresponding analytic procedures, have put the epidemiologist in a position to make a serious effort to control confounding. The extent to which the inclusion of standard disease risk factors, as determined by questionnaire, in logistic regression or Cox regression analyses guards against confounding by poorly measured potential confounding factors is unclear. Such factors include those related to physical activity or diet, or biobehavioral factors. However, typical observational study confounding factors should go some distance in reducing the source of bias.Exposure measurement error, on the other hand, is much less explored in terms of plausible magnitude of impact on observational study results in the exercise and diet arena. There has been some study of energy consumption reporting as a function of body weight. In one sizeable study, energy consumption on food diaries tended to be substantially less than corresponding doubly labeled water estimates among obese persons, with little difference among normal weight persons . Studies of breast cancer occurrence in the U.K. find rather different relationships to dietary fat intake, depending on the type of dietary assessment instrument applied . The OPEN study reported positive assessment error correlations for energy and protein between a food frequency instrument and 24-hour dietary recalls. This finding reduces the plausibility that a self-report assessment can serve as a \"reference instrument\" that adheres to Equation 1.1 for the purpose of calibrating a food frequency assessment in a cohort study analysis. These studies are not definitive, but they do raise the measurement error issue as one that needs to be resolved if nutrition and physical activity observational studies are to have a clear and direct interpretation.\n",

      "Given the challenges associated with observational studies in physical activity and nutritional epidemiology, why not go directly to the randomized controlled trial of physical activity or dietary interventions and cancer incidence among healthy persons? Indeed, disease rate comparisons will not be confounded by prerandomization factors, whether or not they can be measured well or even recognized. Furthermore, such comparisons do not depend on physical activity or dietary assessment for their validity although such assessments for the randomized groups as a whole are needed for trial interpretation. In addition, an intervention trial setting can provide an excellent context for outcome ascertainment that is common across intervention groups.These types of considerations have caused the randomized, controlled trial to be the central study design in most therapeutic research settings. However, disease prevention research has some critical practical limitations. Specifically, because the outcomes targeted for prevention have low incidence rates over a trial follow-up period of a few years' duration, preventative trials typically need to be very large scale, perhaps in the tens of thousands. Difficult logistics and great expense typically attend such large trials, so a handful at most can be supported at a given point in time. Furthermore, the physical activity or dietary changes to be tested may be difficult to maintain over the several years that may be required to affect chronic disease risk by a detectable amount. Also, a range of other behavioral changes may accompany the changes targeted by the interventions under study, thus reducing the etiologic, but perhaps not the public health, implications of trial results.For the reasons just outlined, proposals to conduct full-scale intervention trials for chronic disease prevention are often met with skepticism and resistance. Critics may examine trial cost estimates and consider the number of individual research grants that could be supported by the requisite amount of funding. Others may question whether the underlying hypothesis or the intervention to achieve study goals has been developed with sufficient care and thoroughness. These are important issues that proponents of a prevention trial must adequately address before a randomized controlled trial can proceed.\n",

      "One response to the cost and logistics issue associated with a full-scale intervention trial having disease outcomes is the use of short-term responses, which may be altered as a part of a carcinogenesis or other disease pathway, as an intervention trial outcome variable. For example, a recent exercise intervention trial was conducted in 173 sedentary, overweight postmenopausal women randomly assigned to a moderate-intensity exercise program or to a control group; outcomes included serum hormone concentrations and body fat distribution . This type of physical activity trial, as well as small-scale human nutrition intervention trials, has an important place in the chronic disease prevention research agenda.With a varied set of meaningful intermediate outcomes, such trials can provide much insight into the disease prevention potential of an intervention and a context for developing intervention procedures that can achieve physical activity and dietary goals and maintain them over the typical trial follow-up period of a few months. Intermediate outcome trials, however, are generally not asufficient replacement for a full-scale trial; in a number of contexts, favorable intermediate outcome changes have been shown not to convey meaningful disease prevention benefits, and interventions may have unsuspected consequences for outcomes other than those targeted for prevention. Thus, appropriate forums are needed to identify the most promising and timely physical activity and nutrition interventions for full-scale testing.\n",

      "Sources of intervention hypotheses in the exercise and nutrition area include observational studies and therapeutic trials. Both sources are valuable. As explained earlier, observational studies may lack specificity due to highly correlated patterns of the consumption of various nutrients and may lack reliability more generally. Furthermore, observational studies may not be well configured to examine the health effects of changes in physical activity or dietary patterns and usually are not concerned with methods and procedures to achieve exercise or dietary goals. On the other hand, therapeutic trials cannot be expected to yield interventions that act predominantly at the early stages of disease development and may infrequently focus on behavioral interventions.For example, preclinical trials of physical activity and diet in rodent systems can provide valuable insights into interventions that may have favorable effects on cancer processes and on processes relevant to other chronic diseases. An interesting special case is provided by studies of dietary restriction in rodents in relation to disease risk and longevity . These types of trials, which typically involve a moderate number of animals and a few months' duration, can inform the small-scale human intervention trials mentioned previously.In both settings, the ongoing development of high-dimensional genotyping, gene and protein expression, and metabolomic approaches provides the opportunity for specific and comprehensive hypothesis development activities. Hypothesis development initiatives need to target a medical model that tailors interventions to a person's genotype as well as specific exposures and characteristics and, equally importantly, a public health model that aims to develop physical activity and nutrition recommendations and interventions applicable to major segments of the general population.\n",

      "In a number of chronic disease prevention settings, one has extensive observational data along with one or more randomized controlled trials, and the results disagree between the two sources. These provide a particular opportunity to assess study design and analysis properties and to identify approaches to strengthening each type of study. For example, in the nutrition area, observational studies of beta-carotene consumption in relation to the incidence of lung and other cancers suggested important preventative potential ; however, subsequent controlled trials found no effect or an apparently adverse effect of beta-carotene supplementation. It remains unclear whether the observational studies were too nonspecific to allow favorable lung cancer trends to be attributed to this specific nutrient or were otherwise misleading, or whether consumption at low levels in food is beneficial but higher level supplementation is harmful. Similarly, observational studies indicating lower colorectal cancer incidence among persons consuming low-fat, high-fiber diets were not supported by subsequent trials of colorectal adenoma recurrence prevention using wheat bran fiber or a low-fat eating pattern . These trials again raise questions about the specificity and reliability of the observational studies, as well as about the utility and necessary follow-up duration in adenoma recurrence trials.A striking example of an apparent observational vs. trial discrepancy arises in studies of combined postmenopausal hormone therapy and coronary heart disease, in which observational studies suggest a 40 to 50% reduction in incidence; however, a recent randomized controlled trial found an incidence rate elevation over a 5.6-year intervention period. Although studies are still under way to explain such discrepancy, an important aspect seems to be a hazard ratio function that is elevated early, but subsequently declines and may reverse direction. Available trial data were highly influenced by the early elevation, although such available observational data depend predominantly on follow-up that begins some years after hormone therapy initiation.The identification of study design and analysis procedures that can avoid these types of discrepancies is an important research goal in the physical activity, diet, and chronic disease prevention research area. The manner and extent to which discrepancies can be resolved and avoided also will help identify the complementary role to be played by observational studies and full-scale intervention trials.\n",

Also, too few research groups are configured to carry out the small-scale exercise or nutrition intervention trials, with a comprehensive set of outcomes, out of which a specific intervention for full-scale testing may arise.

      "Despite the available research and the known benefits of physical activity, 45% of U.S. adults do not accumulate a sufficient amount of physical activity to derive health benefits and 16% do not engage in any physical activity during their leisure time . Because many health experts attribute the obesity epidemic and elevated risks for some chronic diseases to physical inactivity , a priority has been placed on the use of valid and reliable measures to assess all levels of physical activity . This is especially true for understudied populations such as ethnic minorities and women .Numerous reviews of physical activity assessment have been conducted in the past decade, including several for self-report , objective activity monitoring , and cancer studies . In 1999, the Cooper Aerobics Institute held a conference specifically for the measurement of physical activity, the proceedings of which were published in a special supplement of Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport . In addition, a reference text for the assessment of physical activity was also recently published .This chapter is limited to the methods used to assess physical activity using direct and indirect measures. For the purposes of this review, direct measures are considered \"real time\" in that they assess physical activity concurrently with the activity. Direct measures include physical activity records, observation, and activity monitors. Indirect methods assess physical activity retrospectively and include self-report questionnaires, structured recall interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic life-history methods. Using direct and indirect methods to assess physical activity is growing in popularity and is recommended by most physical activity researchers as a more comprehensive way of indexing a person's physical activity.\n",

      "LaMonte and Ainsworth present a conceptual framework for the measurement of movement as a global construct. The construct has two dimensions: physical activity and energy expenditure . Both dimensions can be measured using the direct and indirect methods depicted in Figure 2.1. This review is limited to the measurement of physical activity and not energy expenditure. However, the measurement of energy expenditure is often used to infer physical activity, especially when measures like doubly labeled water and activity monitors are used. This partly reflects the controversy in public health about whether a minimal level of energy expenditure or bodily movement leads to the protective benefits of physical activity .Activity monitors often provide estimates of energy expenditure and bodily movement; when they are validated, they are compared to actual energy expenditure, not body movement . Selfreport is much more complex because no objective assessment of bodily movement is made. Instead, the type, duration, frequency, and intensity are assessed; this may be used to estimate energy expenditure and then related to health outcomes .\n",

      "The four basic types of activity monitors: measure acceleration ; measure the movement of the body up and down when a person lifts the feet off the ground ; monitor heart rate; and measure changes in body temperature. An accelerometer detects acceleration and deceleration in one or more planes of motion . A uniaxial accelerometer measures acceleration in the vertical plane, and biaxial and triaxial accelerometers are sensitive to movements in two and three dimensions, respectively. When these devices detect movement, an electric current proportional to the degree of acceleration is generatedwithin the motion sensor. Because acceleration increases in several dimensions with faster movements, theoretically, accelerometers should accurately determine energy expenditure across a wide range of exercise intensities .At least 13 different pedometers are available for research ; however, to date, the Yamax models are the most accurate. Although many heart rate monitors are commercially available, almost all studies have been done using Polar models because of their ability to store large amounts of information . Finally, the SenseWear Armband is a new device that contains a biaxial accelerometer, a heart rate receiver, and a thermocoupler with the unique capability of measuring heat production.Which monitor is \"best\" depends a great deal on the target population, the monetary resources of the project, the time and labor available to the project, and the research questions. No activity monitor provides the type of activity engaged in, and thus some kind of self-report must always accompany the monitor if this is an important research question. The accelerometers can store up to 30 days of minute-to-minute activity; however, they cost approximately $500 per monitor and hours of labor and computer programming are necessary to consolidate data into meaningful intensity, frequency, and duration information. The BioTrainer Pro has demonstrated the poorest validity for the measurement of energy expenditure of all the available accelerometers ; the CSA with the Freedson correction for energy expenditure and the TriTrac R3D have the best validity.Pedometers provide the most user friendly and economical approach to activity monitoring. In addition, they are often excellent sources of immediate feedback for participants . However, they cannot \"store\" daily activity data, so participants must record their steps each day, and they have limited validity in assessing any activities that are not related to walking . Finally, although expensive , the SenseWear Armband may have some promise as a research tool. It seems to be a valid indicator of energy expenditure at a variety of walking speeds and its position on the upper arm avoids the extraneous movement common to accelerometers worn around the waist .\n",

      "One of the most accurate, comprehensive direct measures of physical activity is systematic observation . Information can be collected about the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of any observable physical activity . This field has been almost exclusively devoted to the observation of school-aged children's physical activity . The two main systems used in research are the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time , its newest variant, the System for Observing Play and Physical Activity in Youth , and the Children's Activity Rating Scale . These tools have been extensively validated in a variety of settings including the classroom , physical education , and after school .Almost no data on behavioral observation in adults are available. Most of this work has been done to examine people's walking and bicycling behavior . Given the utility of behavioralobservation in providing detailed information about all aspects of physical activity - especially descriptions of type - this area should be more extensively developed in adult and elderly populations.\n",

      "Physical activity records provide a detailed account of activities done within a given period of time . Records are useful in identifying the type, duration, and frequency of activities and may take the form of a written diary or record book, dictation into a tape recorder, or by recalling the prior days' activities in the presence of a trained interviewer. Physical activity records have been used to describe activity patterns in populations and to validate physical activity questionnaires . Irwin and colleagues provide detailed instructions in the use of a physical activity record.The precision of physical activity records has been studied using doubly labeled water. Irwin et al. compared recorded physical activity in the form of estimated energy expenditure with doubly labeled water kilocalories obtained during a 7-day period, showing difference in kilocalorie estimates on the order of 7.9 ± 3.2% kcal. Unfortunately, physical activity records have many drawbacks, mostly concerning the large participant burden and limited application to people with low-literacy skills. Recording physical activity can interfere with daily activities, resulting in poor compliance to study protocols. In addition, physical activity records share with qualitative data the expense of time in coding descriptive information into quantitative data. However, with the refinement of hand-held tape recorders, palm pilots with voice- and handwriting-recognition software to facilitate recording and coding of physical activity records, the drawbacks related to participant burden and data management may be minimized . Advancements in voice-recognition software will eliminate the need for writing altogether, increasing the use of physical activity records in lowliteracy populations [451.\n",

      "Physical activity logs are checklists used to record the type and duration of activities performed during intermittent periods of the day or at the end of a single day. A good example is the Bouchard Physical Activity Log , which has users check the type and intensity of activity that they complete every 15 minutes during a specific period of the day. Another example is the Ainsworth Physical Activity Log that has users review a list of activities at the end of each day and estimate the total duration in hours and/or minutes during which they performed each activity . Physical activity logs can be tailored for specific research or practice settings to reflect the purposes of a study or to highlight specific activities performed. For example, a walking log may focus only on walking activities performed in specific settings, such as occupation, transportation, household, and leisure settings . These logs may also be tailored to monitor physical activity during clinical trials to track the types and amounts of activity performed in supervised and freeliving settings.Physical activity logs have advantages over detailed records in that they substantially reduce the burden of recording for the participants. However, the trade-off comes with the limitation that physical activity logs provide less detailed information about specific activities performed and are subject to recall bias; thus, they may not be as accurate as direct detailed records.\n",

Several validated questionnaires are available in the public domain with 1-month test-retest reliabilities from r = 0.80 to 0.90 . Validity is on the order of r = 0.30 when compared with cardiorespiratory fitness, activity monitors, and physical activity records .

      "Self-administered recall questionnaires assess the frequency and duration of specific activities for 1 to 2 weeks in the past. The questionnaires may be completed in person, by postal mail, or by email. Examples of two commonly used self-administered questionnaires are the Paffenbarger College Alumni Questionnaire and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire . The former is a postal mail questionnaire that assesses the frequency and duration of walking, stari climbing, and sports and recreational activities performed in the past week. Adjustments are made for the number of weeks per year during which the sports and recreational activities are performed. A summary score in kilocalories per week is computed from the intensity, frequency in days per week, and duration in hours or minutes per event for each activity recalled. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire assesses the hours per day and days per week spent in various moderate and vigorous intensity activities, walking activities, and sedentary activities. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire has been evaluated in international settings and is available for download in various languages at Scoring protocols for recall questionnaires vary widely, ranging from simple ordinal scales that reflect participation levels to comprehensive scores that reflect the intensity, frequency, and duration of reported activities . Many studies have assessed the reliability and validity of recall questionnaires; most have 1-month test-retest reliability in cross-sectional settings on the order of r = 0.60 to 0.75 and r = 0.30 for validity against actual measures of energy expenditure, activity monitors, and physical activity records .Limitations in the use of recall questionnaires relate to errors in recall that may result in biased measures of physical activity. For example, Rzewnicki and colleagues noted overreporting of vigorous activities on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire when it was compared with other physical activity assessment methods. This suggests that care be taken in selecting selfadministered questionnaires as the primary method of measuring physical activity, especially if the purpose is to assess changes in physical activity in research studies.\n",

      "Interview-administered recall questionnaires provide information about the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity performed during a brief period in the past, ranging from 24 hours to 7 days. Technically, any self-administered physical activity recall questionnaire can beadministered by an interviewer. This is often the case when the study involves low-literacy populations. Interview protocols differ from self-administered physical activity recall questionnaires in that they generally use a series of questions and probes asked by a trained interviewer over the telephone or in person. As a participant answers the interviewer's questions, the information is recorded on a form tailored for the specific setting. The advantage of this interview method is that clarification can be obtained about a person's physical activity and a great deal of detail can be obtained about all elements of the behavior.Two of the most common interview-administered physical activity recall protocols are the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall and the Previous Day Physical Activity Recall. The Seven Day Physical Activity Recall is one of the most widely used and validated measures of self-reported physical activity , and has undergone several revisions . It has been used with adults , minorities , and adolescents . Participants are asked to recall their sleep, and moderate, hard, and very hard physical activities for morning, afternoon, and evening hours in the past 7 days. Activities are then summarized in 10- to 15-minute blocks in weekend, weekday, work, and nonwork categories.The Previous Day Physical Activity Recall was developed for use with school-aged children . Older children can self-administer this recall method, but, for younger children , the Previous Day Physical Activity Recall is administered by an interviewer. Physical and sedentary activities are recorded in 30-minute blocks by type and intensity, using a list of activities and illustrations to help children with their self-report.As with self-administered recall questionnaires, recall interviews of physical activity are affected substantially from recall bias. This is especially problematic with moderate intensity activities that do not seem to make the same impression in participant memories as more intense physical activities . Evidence suggests that activities recalled from the first day in the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall are not any more accurate than those recalled from the last day in the interview . This is primarily because of the extensive probing and memory cues used in the interview protocol. In addition, no studies using the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall in the elderly have been published. Although decrements in memory occur with advanced age, the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall protocol lends itself well to a variety of memory-enhancement exercises that could substantially improve physical activity recall in this group of adults.\n",

      "Quantitative history questionnaires assess physical activity for a long period in the past, usually from 1 year to a lifetime, and assess the frequency and duration of multiple types of physical activity. The questionnaires may be age or activity specific and may be used to assess physical activity behaviors associated with specific outcomes such as cancer or cardiovascular disease .A well-known quantitative history questionnaire is the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire used in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial and in various other settings . The Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire is an intervieweradministered questionnaire that has respondents check one of 74 activities performed within the past year. For each activity checked, respondents indicate the number of months per year, times per month, and average hours and minutes during which they were active.To date, only one quantitative history questionnaire has proven effective in demonstrating physical activity changes in response to behavior change interventions : the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed to assess changes in the weekly frequency and duration of various physical activities performed by older men and women. The questionnaire has adequate validity and reliability and is stable in measuring physical activity over a 6-month period .Quantitative history recall questionnaires are limited by the difficulty in validating the questionnaires because it is often impossible to obtain objective measures of physical activity from long periods in the past, especially for instruments that assess lifetime physical activity. Reliability is generally acceptable . Lifetime questionnaires have the greatest utility in the study of the impact of physical activity on diseases that have a long latency period between the exposure and outcomes, such as cancer and osteoporosis.\n",

      "Despite advancements in the quantitative assessment of physical activity, researchers still do not understand why some adults engage in physical activity and others do not. Physical activity researchers have also had great difficulty to date creating culturally appropriate and age- and genderspecific instruments. Part of the reason for this is that they are not engaging in systematic instrument development with populations who are consistently identified as physically inactive . Instead, researchers often use whatever seems to have the highest published validity, reliability, and ease of use and then \"adapt\" it for use with the studied populations. This may be ineffective when they are trying to identify physical activity patterns of distinct population groups .Qualitative data collection methods are particularly suited to the study of physical activity behaviors in understudied populations. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews are two of many qualitative data collection methods. Focus groups have their foundations in business market research and are conducted in groups of eight to ten participants purposely selected from the target population to come together and discuss a particular topic area . A group moderator guides participants through a brief script of approximately three to five questions about a particular topic, with probes used to better understand the responses. Traditionally, the focus groups are audio-recorded and then the audiotapes are transcribed verbatim for later analysis. Several studies have used this approach to explore physical activity in a variety of ethnic groups and then used the information to develop quantitative surveys to measure physical activity .The best self-report tool that currently exists for exploring the determinants of physical activity in a culturally relevant way is the life-history ethnographic interview . Although developed for cultural anthropology investigations, this procedure has increasingly been applied to the study of health-related behaviors . Much of the work in this area has focused on elucidating explanatory models of health and disease in minority cultures . Investigators have applied ethnographic interviewing to the study of ethnic minority women's explanatory models of weight management and physical activity .\n",

      "Many methods to assess physical activity in research and practice settings have been presented. The methods vary in complexity and the amount of information given. The use of a specific instrument should reflect the needs for the research or practice setting. For population studies and national surveillance systems, global or short-recall questionnaires are the preferred method because they are short, easy for respondents to understand, and relatively simple to score. On the other hand, experimental studies are better suited for the use of activity momitors, physical activity records and logs, and/or observation systems to assess physical activity because they provide a higher level of precision needed to quantify the effects of the intervention in modifying physical activity behaviors. Using a combination of questionnaires and direct methods to assess physical activity will substantially increase the amount of information obtained about a target population's physical activity. Finally, when working with a new population, it is best to begin with qualitative data collection methods to assess physical activity and then proceed to tailored instrument creation,instead of adapting an existing questionnaire for a new population without an understanding of the cultural context for physical activity in that population.\n",

However, it is not always possible to use direct methods based on the setting and study design. When questionnaires are used to assess physical activity, care should be taken to use instruments with the highest validity and reliability for the population group to be studied. Furthermore, questionnaires that are effective in detecting changes in physical activity behaviors should be used in pre-post experimental study designs.

      "Obesity is an established risk factor for cancer and other chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes . The prevalence of obesity is increasing among youths and adults in developed and developing countries. Presently, there is no precise clinical definition of obesity based on actual measures of body fat because of the difficulty of collecting such data. Consensus exists for an indirect measure of body fat, called body mass index . BMI is easily obtained and reliable for overweight and obese persons, and several studies have shown that BMI is highly correlated with percent body fat.In 1997, the World Health Organization developed a classification system for overweight and obesity based on grades of BMI values related to increasing risk of comorbidity. A BMI of between 25 and 29 was defined as overweight and a BMI of ≥ 30 was defined as obesity . Recent estimates indicate that 34% of the adult American population is overweight and that 31% are obese .The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults and children in the United States and around the world has highlighted the need for accurate and reliable methods to assess body fat levels. An accurate assessment of body fat is necessary to identify properly a patient's health risk associated with an excessively low or high relative body fat. This assessment can then be used to estimate a patient's ideal body weight and develop an exercise and diet program. Periodic body fat measurements can be used to assess the effectiveness of exercise and diet interventions or monitor changes in body fat associated with growth or disease states. Thus, accurate and precise assessment methods that are sensitive enough to track small changes in body fat are essential for assessing the effects of intervention programs designed to decrease body fat.Within the last decade, the accuracy and availability of body fat methodology has improved. Because body fat has been linked to numerous health conditions, there is a clinical need to measure percent body fat and fat distribution as well. Whatever the reason for assessing body fat, health educators, exercise physiologists, nutritionists, and other clinicians should have a general understanding of the most commonly used techniques for assessing body fat. A variety of methods are available to assess body fat, some direct and some less direct. Direct methods - also referred to in this chapter as laboratory-based methods - are used primarily in clinical research centers where accurate and precise measurements are essential. Methods such as densitometry, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , and ultrasound are examples of direct methods.Indirect methods, also referred to in this chapter as field-based methods, provide estimates of body fat. These methods are based on assumptions regarding the density of fat mass and fat-free mass and the concentrations of water and electrolytes in the body. The accuracy and precision of indirect methods depend on their validation against results from direct methods. The adaptability and ease of use with large groups makes indirect methods applicable in epidemiological studies and in public health and obesity screening programs. Body weight, BMI, circumferences, skinfolds, and bioelectrical impedance are examples of indirect methods.The definition of laboratory or field methods can be somewhat arbitrary, but it is usually bound by the available resources, type and quality of information sought, and location of the study. Some other factors that should be considered when defining an ideal body fat method are: cost, training of operator, maintenance and operating costs, precision, and accuracy. If only weight and height are of interest, for example, these data can be obtained using only a scale and tape measure, and the sophisticated technologies described in the following sections are not needed. However, if the objective is to determine the body's fat mass or its internal component, the more robust methods must be used.The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of selected body fat methods that are most likely to be used in the lab or field for assessing body fat in large-scale epidemiological, clinical, or anthropometrical studies, examine their validity and reliability, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each method. The chapter is subdivided into laboratory methods and field methods. Several advanced methods, such as neutron activation, gamma resonance absorption, or whole-body potassium counting will not be presented here because they are not routinely used in human body fat studies . Information beyond that presented in this chapter can be found in textbooks and other peer-reviewed manuscripts .\n",

      "The classical method of assessing body fat in vivo is densitometry. This method assumes that the body consists of two compartments, the fat mass and the fat free mass , so that weight = fat mass + fat free mass, each with its own specific and assumed constant density: 0.9007 g/cm³ and 1.1000 g/cm³, respectively. Determining the density of the body allows a calculation of the ratio of fat mass to fat free mass ; when body weight is known, the absolute and relative amounts of fat mass and fat free mass can be calculated. Density is weight divided by volume, and the methods that are now used to determine body volume are hydrodensitometry and air displacement plethysmography. Underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography are strictly bound to a laboratory setting because the instruments are not portable.\n",

      "Hydrodensitometry or underwater weighing was developed mainly as a means to measure body density to assess body fat. Because of its early development and widespread use, the measurement of body density, via underwater weighing, is often referred to as a gold standard for body fat measurements. Underwater weighing is based on Archimedes' principle: a body immersed in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid; thus, if a person's weight is measured in air and then when completely immersed in water, density can be calculated: density = weight /volume = weight of body in air /weight of body in air – weight of body in water . Thus, underwater weighing, as the name implies, requires the subject to be completely submerged in water . Additionally, the subject needs to remain relatively motionless underwater in order for a trained technician to get an accurate reading of the subject's underwater weight.This procedure must be repeated multiple times for a valid and reliable reading. Generally, it is repeated until three trials within 100 g of each other are obtained. The average of these three trials is used as the underwater weighing for the calculation of body density . Further adjustments are needed for water density, which depends on water temperature, and the volume of air in the respiratory system when the underwater weight is measured. This latter volume is normally the ventilated residual volume. The body density formula is: body density = - residual volume. Body density is then converted to percent body fat using regression equations developed by Siri or Brozek et al. . For example, using Brozek's equation, if body weight is equal to unity with the two compartments represented as proportions such that fat mass - fat free mass = 1, then: 1/bone density = fat mass density + fat free mass/fat free mass density. Using densities of 0.9007 and 1.100 g/cm³ for fat mass and fat free mass, respectively, it can be shown that: % fat mass = - 4.142 × 100. Body fat as a percentage of body weight calculated from the Siri equation is: % fat = × 100. The Siri and Brozek equations produce values within 1% body fat of each other.For the residual volume correction, the recommended method is oxygen dilution with a closedcircuit spirometer system . However, residual volume is not routinely performed but instead approximated using prediction equations. Unfortunately, predicted residual volume can result in residual volume variations that affect the estimation of percent body fat by as much as 8% . Therefore, residual volume should not be predicted from age, height, body weight, or vital capacity. By comparison, errors associated with incorrect underwater weights and body weight fluctuations due to factors affecting hydration status are not as large, with a 2- to 3-kg weight fluctuation producing a change in relative body fat of only 1% . Regarding the total cumulative error for percent body fat, it has been estimated to be on the order of 3 to 4% of body weight for the individual .A major potential source of measurement error for this method is the formula used to convert body density to body fat. For years, the classic two-component models of Siri and Brozek have been the basis of underwater weighing estimates of % body fat. Both conversion formulas were based on direct analysis of a limited number of white male and female cadavers that did not necessarily represent the entire population. The Siri and Brozek conversion formulas assume that the density of fat mass and fat free mass density are constant for all individuals. Research documents that fat free mass density is not constant for all individuals, but rather varies with age, gender, body fatness, physical activity, and race/ethnicity . Fat free mass changes from birth onward and the density of the fat free mass is thus likely not \"constant\" across the lifespan. Because of these limitations, underwater weighing cannot be considered a gold standard method. However, regarding precision, Ward et al. reported good test-retest reliability .Underwater weighing has many flaws and may not be a practical technique for many subjects. Because subjects are required to exhale completely while submerged, this difficult maneuver requires a great deal of cooperation by the subject and the overall measurement period is quite time consuming . Another limitation of underwater weighing is that it is difficult for an overweight or obese person to submerge. Underwater weighing also may not be easy to undertake with elderly or physically disabled persons or individuals with diseases. Furthermore, to ensure an accurate measure of body volume from underwater weighing, residual volume requires a skilled technician and is difficult, and sometimes impossible, for some subjects to perform. Lastly, the underwater weighing instrumentation is priced moderately and requires high maintenance and a well-trained operator. These limitations have shown that this method is not suited for laboratory-based body fat methods.\n",

      "The overall density of the human body may be measured using water displacement, i.e., underwater weighing, or air displacement. For years, UWW has been considered by some experts as a gold standard method. However, because of the limitations noted earlier, a new technique for measuring body density and, in turn, body fat has been developed has the potential to become a field method. The instrument used is the Bod Pod® . The Bod Pod is a large, egg-shaped fiberglass chamber. This method is based on air displacement plethysmography and uses the relationship between pressure and volume to derive body volume. The physical design and the operating principles of air displacement plethysmography have been described in detail elsewhere .The instrument consists of two chambers; the subject sits in one chamber and the other serves as a reference. With the subject in one chamber, the door is closed and sealed, the pressure increased slightly, and a diaphragm, separating the two chambers, is oscillated to alter the volumes slightly. The classic relationship of pressure vs. volume at a fixed temperature is used to solve for the volume of the subject chamber. The volumes of the two chambers are varied slightly and the difference in air pressure is recorded. The subject's body volume is calculated using corrections for isothermal properties of the air in the lungs and near the skin's surface.From the subject's perspective, the procedures are quite simple. Wearing minimal clothing so as not to alter body surface area calculations, swim cap , and nose clip. the subject enters and sits in the fiberglass chamber for two trials of approximately 45 sec each. The Bod Pod is sealed, and the subject breathes normally for 20 sec while body volume is measured. The subject is then connected to a breathing tube that is connected to the reference chamber in the rear of the Bod Pod to measure thoracic gas volume. The subject resumes tidal breathing through the tube. After three breathing cycles, a valve in the circuit momentarily occludes the airway. At this point, the subject gently \"puffs\" by alternately contracting and relaxing the diaphragm. This effort produces small pressure fluctuations in the airway and chamber that are used to determine thoracic gas volume. This value is used to correctbody volume for thoracic gas volume. The body volume is equal to the volume of air in an empty chamber minus the volume of air remaining in the chamber after the subject enters it. The percent body fat is then calculated using the Siri equation .Studies using air displacement plethysmography have shown very good agreement with the underwater weighing method in healthy adults and children . This may prove to be a more valid and reliable method than underwater weighing, especially for older adults, physically challenged individuals, and those afraid of being submerged underwater. Air displacement plethysmography has been reported to be a highly reliable method for determining percent body fat in adult humans . Although not significantly different, the same-day test-retest reliability of the air displacement plethysmography was slightly better than it was for underwater weighing, with the average coefficients of variation being 1.7 and 2.3% for air displacement plethysmography and underwater weighing, respectively. The mean difference in percent body fat between the two methods was only 0.3% . However, at the individual level differences were quite large, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -9% to +7% body fat .Air displacement plethysmography is a quicker, more convenient, and an easier test to administer than underwater weighing ; therefore, it has the potential to reduce technician error. The air displacement plehtysmography method involves little effort on the part of the subject, thereby reducing within-subject error. Another advantage is that the subject does not need to be submerged under water, although he or she still needs to wear a swimsuit and cap. Another advantage is that the measurement time is only a few minutes.Disadvantages or limitations of air displacement plethysmography are that the devices of this method are limited to persons who are \"moderately\" obese at best - i.e., someone with a BMI > 30 may be difficult to assess. Another major drawback of air displacement plethysmography is the high cost of the instrument . The same assumptions for converting body density to percent body fat that limit underwater weihing also exist for air displacement plethysmography. Thus, even if all the technical limitations can be corrected, the question of the physiological accuracy of using a common fat free mass density among individuals still remains. The assumption of a fixed density will produce a larger error of fat free mass than the cumulative technical errors associated with the density measurement. Thus, without additional knowledge of the density of the fat free mass, underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography techniques may best serve to identify outliers in a population.\n",

      "Three major techniques are used for imaging of the body: dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , computed tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging . Many scientists consider these methods the standards for precision and accuracy for body fat measurements . Furthermore, DEXA, CT, and MRI provide the only presently fully approach for measuring body fat distribution . However, a significant advantage of CT and MRI is the ability to assess not only abdominal body fat, but also the important visceral adipose tissue compartment and intramuscular fat - information that is presently not available with any other body fat methods. Recently, ultrasound has been used as a technique for assessing body fat, specifically visceral adipose tissue.\n",

      "DEXA is a relatively new technique developed in the 1980s mainly to diagnose osteoporosis. When DEXA is applied, a subject, lying supine on a padded table, is scanned from head to toe with x-rays of two energy levels . Based on the different attenuation coefficients of minerals and soft tissue on the one hand, and of soft tissue between lean mass and fat mass on the other, the composition of the body can be calculated in terms of bone mineral, lean tissue, andfat tissue. Fat mass, as well as bone mineral content and lean tissue mass, is derived according to computer algorithms provided by the manufacturer . Most important, the attenuation of soft tissue can now be measured rather than assumed, as is the case with underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography. The average skin dose of radiation is 1 to 3 mrad per DEXA scan , which is comparable to the skin exposure from a week of environmental background radiation .At present, three manufacturers provide DEXA devices measuring body fat: Hologic Inc. , Lunar Radiation Corp , and Norland Medical Systems . The DEXA instruments from different manufacturers are unique in implementation but based on the same theoretical principles. DEXA devices are composed principally of a generator emitting x-rays of two energies, a scanning table, a detector, and a computer system. The fundamental physical principle behind DEXA is presented in a review by Genton et al. . Percent body fat has been shown to vary among manufacturers , the data collection mode , and the software version used to analyze the data .Only the DEXA manufacturers have developed standard software that can measure body fat. Furthermore, the physical limitations of weight, length, thickness, and width also vary with each manufacturer and type of DEXA machine. For example, weight limitations are 100 and 136 kg for current Lunar and Hologic machines, respectively, and appropriate for a person of average height and a maximum BMI of between 31 and 43. However, these manufacturers have a body width restriction of about 60 to 66 cm, and Lunar has a body thickness limit of 26 cm. These limits are a function of the available table scan area of the machines. Thus, bodies of many obese individuals are too wide or thick to receive a whole-body DEXA scan with current machines, although some innovative adaptations, such as scanning an obese person twice, have been proposed .Although DEXA was originally used to measure bone density and total body fat, recent improvements in software allow it to determine abdominal fat mass. Glickman et al. examined the validity and reliability of DEXA to measure abdominal fat accurately in 65 men and women aged 18 to 72 using a Lunar DPX-IQ scanner. Multislice CT scans were performed between L1 and L4 vertebral bodies. Abdominal total tissue mass and abdominal fat mass were significantly lower as measured by DEXA compared to CT. However, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good concordance between DEXA and CT for abdominal total tissue mass and fat mass . DXA also showed excellent reliability .Although DEXA was found to be reliable and reproducible in the estimation of abdominal adipose tissue, it does not allow the visual distinction between visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue. However, combining DEXA and waist circumference data accounted for 84% of the variance in CT-derived visceral adipose tissue , providing researchers with a method to estimate VAT using DEXA. The equation to predict VAT is: VAT = DEXA L1-L4 fat mass + WC .DEXA is highly reliable, with repeated measurements over 1 day in the same subject demonstrating CVs of about 0.8% for fat . Mazess et al. reported excellent short-term precision for DEXA. Ten measurements each on 12 subjects were conducted over a period of 1 week. The authors reported a precision error for fat mass equal to 1.4%. The short- and long-term precision of DEXA was assessed by Johnson and Dawson–Hughes . They scanned subjects six times initially and then again 9 months later. The CV for fat mass was 2.7% at the start of the study and 1.7% after 9 months.Many studies have now examined DEXA accuracy in animals and humans. DEXA fat estimates in species ranging widely in body size are highly correlated with corresponding criterion estimates, such as chemical analysis of cadavers. Good agreement is also present between percent body fat estimates obtained by underwater weighing and DEXA . In studies that compared underwater weighing to DEXA, investigators have found DEXA to be a better predictor of mean percent bodyfat than underwater weighing . DEXA may have the greatest sensitivity to changes in body fat with exercise. In a study by Houtkooper et al. in which postmenopausal women were exercise-trained, SDs for changes in body fat were the smallest for DEXA estimates. Consequently, the estimates of percent body fat from DEXA had the smallest variability and therefore, when compared with results from underwater weighing, were the most sensitive measures for detecting small changes in body fat in this sample of women.The DEXA model is an important advance in body fat methodology. DEXA is an attractive alternative to underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography as a reference method because it is a safe, noninvasive method that involves only a small radiation dose and is accurate and precise . DEXA is rapid , requires minimal subject cooperation, and, most importantly, accounts for individual variability in fat free mass. It is also less affected by and therefore less prone to the errors associated with the underlying assumptions inherent in UWW and ADP. DEXA evaluations are relatively inexpensive to carry out. The greatest advantage of DEXA over other laboratory methods may be the ability to assess regional as well as total body fat and analyze separate compartments of the body.Because DEXA does not rely on the assumption of a two-component model to provide estimates of body fat and does not depend on subject performance, it is sometimes regarded as a standard against which other methods can be validated. However, like most other methods for measuring body fat, DEXA is also subject to errors . Limitations of DEXA are the high initial capital investment, the need for a highly trained technical staff, and the high annual maintenance and service costs. Also, tissue depth has an impact on the total attenuation of the body, so the method has different accuracy in obese persons compared with lean persons . In summary, owing to its nature, the method is not suitable for most field studies. Nevertheless, DEXA is a safe, quick, accurate, and reliable method for measuring body fat in the majority of the population.\n",

      "CT has been considered the most accurate and reproducible technique of body fat measurement , particularly abdominal adipose tissue. Since 1990, CT has been proposed as the gold standard method to quantify abdominal obesity . Despres and Lamarche observed that a visceral fat area of 130 cm2 was associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events in 213 men and 190 women. More recently, a visceral adipose tissue ≥ 106 cm² was associated with an elevated risk in 233 persons.The use of CT and MRI allows for three-dimensional information of body fat. In contrast to DEXA, the information is obtained on a tissue level, rather than a chemical level, so adipose tissue rather than chemical body fat is determined. For comparison, adipose tissue can be converted to body fat assuming that 80% of adipose tissue is fat. CT and MRI can be used to get information on total body fat; however, because of the radiation and/or price of measurements, they are usually used to obtain information on body fat distribution .From the subject's perspective. CT is quite simple. The subject lies on a padded table for scanning. One scan is usually performed using a lateral-view radiograph of the skeleton to establish the position of the L4-L5 space within 1.0 mm. A second scan is then performed at the L4–L5 space . Ideally, following the scanning. one technician then measures the subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat areas using a commercial software application that identifies and measures each of the areas of interest by tracing lines around them and computing the circumscribed areas.Although available for nearly 30 years, CT was only minimally applied in body fat research because of expense and radiation exposure . The importance of CT is that the method producescross-sectional images of tissue-system level components at predefined anatomic locations, via a rotating x-ray tube and detector, which moves in a perpendicular plane to the subject. The CT x-rays are attenuated as they penetrate tissues and Fourier analysis or filtered back projection is used in reconstructing the image. Image analysis software then allows estimation of the adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and other tissue-system level component pixels, or \"picture elements,\" translate to respective tissue areas. The CT number assigned to each pixel is a measure of photon attenuation relative to air and water . Air, adipose tissue, nonadipose lean tissues, and skeleton pixels all have characteristic CT number ranges. Acquiring images at predefined intervals and then integrating tissue component areas permits reconstruction of whole-body components such as skeletal muscle mass .CT can now quantify the mass of all major organs and tissues. The CT images can also be used to separate the total adipose tissue mass into its subcutaneous and visceral components, or the lean tissues into skeletal muscle and visceral or organ mass.Reconstruction of total body mass and separate organ masses based on scans along the length of the body at 10-cm intervals has been shown to have excellent accuracy and precision . It has also been shown that CT provides a more accurate determination of visceral adipose tissue than MRI does . Extensive validation studies for CT include human and animal cadavers. Rossner et al. compared adipose tissue estimates by CT with corresponding planimetry measurements of corresponding band-sawed slices from two male cadavers. Strong correlations were present between the two types of area estimates .\n",

      "MRI is based on interaction between nuclei of hydrogen atoms and magnetic fields produced and controlled by the MRI's instrumentation. Protons have a magnetic moment that causes them to function as small magnets. Under usual conditions in the earth's weak magnetic field, these magnetic moments are randomly oriented, and they tend to cancel each other. When a subject is placed inside the scanner's high-field strength magnet proton, magnetic moments tend to align longitudinally to the external magnet's field. A pulsed radio-frequency field is then applied to body tissues, causing some of the aligned hydrogen protons to absorb energy . Several excellent reviews of the practical aspects of the MRI measurement have been presented previously .To obtain MRI data, the subject is positioned in the magnet's bore in a prone or supine position. Typically, a 320-mm region of the body is imaged in a single acquisition. The time required to obtain multiple images is the same as that required to obtain a single image. Therefore, in most MRI studies, multiple images of a given region are obtained in a single acquisition. Depending on the pulse frequency used, the time needed for an abdominal image can take 8 to 10 min or more, although recent technological advances may have reduced this time to ~30 sec per slice . For a whole-body measurement, a series of multiple scans along the length of the body is needed, which may require the subject to be in the magnet's bore for 30 min or longer.Cross-sectional abdominal images obtained with MRI allow for separation of the SAT from the visceral adipose tissue compartment. The coefficient of variation for repeated measures of subcutaneous adipose tissue ranges from 1 to 10% . The coefficient of variation for visceral adipose tissue estimates is higher — 6 to 11% — as a result of measurement errors associated with respiratory motion. Human cadaver studies were used by Abate et al. to examine the validity of MRI SAT and visceral adipose tissue estimates. The overall agreement between dissection weight and MRI-estimated adipose tissue weights was 6% or 0.08 kg.Some consideration should be given to whether to use CT or MRI to characterize the adipose tissue content and distribution in humans. There is generally good agreement between CT- and MRI-derived measures of regional body fat , and both methods are highly reproducible and reliable . The lower coefficient of variation of CT compared to MRI is usually ascribed to a shorter image acquisition time, and CT is thus less vulnerable to image artifacts produced by gastrointestinal tract movement .A limitation to CT and MRI is that access to the scanners is limited and cost in most centers is prohibitive. Additionally, the time required for analysis of the images can be substantial. Although the scan times for CT are shorter than for MRI, with MRI there is no ionizing radiation, making the acquisition of multiple images more practical. However, if the pixel resolution required for routine CT scans can be relaxed, the dose can be significantly reduced. Studies have shown that a ten-scan image of the trunk region can be obtained with an effective dose of <0.3 mSv, which is about 1/25 that of a routine clinical CT scan . It would be quite difficult to collect MRI and CT data from many of the obese because they are too large for the opening in the magnet or the scanner. In summary, CT and MRI provide the only presently fully approach for estimating the important visceral adipose tissue compartment .\n",

      "CT and MRI have been considered the most accurate and reproducible techniques of body fat measurement, particularly abdominal adipose tissue. However, both are costly and time-consuming measures and involve exposure to radiation. Because of these limitations, alternative methods, such as ultrasound, are being used to assess fat distribution and to estimate intra-abdominal fat deposition.In 1990, Armellini et al. proposed the use of ultrasound for the quantification of visceral adiposity as an alternative technique to CT. Ultrasound allows the individual visualization of subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. In addition, ultrasound is a noninvasive and quick method with good reproducibility rates and lower costs than CT scans . However, specific equipment and a well-trained examiner are required. Ultrasonography is performed using a highresolution ultrasonographic system and a 7.5- or 3.5-MHz probe. Subjects are examined in the supine position with all frozen images obtained immediately after respiration to avoid the influence of the respiratory status.Recently, Ribeiro–Filho et al. compared ultrasound for the assessment of visceral adipose tissue as an alternative to CT and also to establish cut-off values to define visceral adiposity based on ultrasound. The study enrolled 100 women, 20 to 65 years of age. Ultrasound procedures were performed using a 3.5-MHz probe located 1 cm from the umbilicus. Two ultrasound measurements of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat were taken. The coefficient of variation for ultrasound was 0.8%. A correlation of r = 0.71 was found between CT-determined visceral fat and ultrasound. Total fat determined by ultrasound correlated with total fat area determined by CT .Similar correlations were observed in studies by Kim et al. and Stolk et al. . Visceral obesity by ultrasound showed a diagnostic concordance of 74% with CT. An ultrasound value of 6.90 cm for visceral distance was found as a diagnostic cut-off for visceral obesity. A noninvasive and less expensive method such as ultrasound may facilitate identification of high-risk patients and allow earlier interventions.\n",

      "Body mass index , defined as weight/height², is the most commonly used field method. For population studies, BMI is generally as a measure of body fatness . Body weight is usually measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a beam balance and body height is usually measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer.The World Health Organization cut-off points of BMI for overweight and obesity are based on observational studies of the relationship between BMI and morbidity and mortality . Because no studies relate directly measured body fat to morbidity and mortality, no clear cut-off points for obesity, based on body fat measurements, are known. Based on the relationship between BMI and percent body fat, one can calculate that, in adults, a BMI value of 30 corresponds to about 25% body fat in males and 35% body fat in females . Because body fat generally increases and fat free mass decreases with increasing age, older subjects will have a higher percent body fat than young subjects of the same BMI .Variations in percent body fat for the same BMI may also be caused by variations in physical activity, fitness, body build, diet, and race or ethnicity . For the same BMI, physically inactive or unfit men and women on average have slightly greater fat mass than physically active or fit men and women . Exercise intervention studies have also demonstrated that, when performed for a sufficient duration, aerobic exercise in the absence of a change in BMI is associated with reductions in total fat mass , subcutaneous adipose tissue , and visceral adipose tissue . In studies by Irwin et al. and Janssen et al. , aerobic exercise training with little or no change in body weight or BMI was associated with significant reductions in total fat mass and visceral adipose tissue fat.Although the World Health Organization and U.S. Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommend BMI as a measure of percent body fat , recent findings have challenged the assumption that BMI has the same meaning in all racial or ethnic groups . A recent metaanalysis of the relationship between BMI and percent body fat among Chinese, Ethiopians, Indonesians, Polynesians, Thais, American blacks, and American whites revealed that people of different ethnic groups had significantly different BMIs at the same levels of body fat, age, and gender . Possible reasons for ethnic differences in the relationship between BMI and percent body fat include differences in fat free mass, the distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and limb length relative to trunk size . These findings suggest that estimates of body fat from BMI may produce systematic errors across different ethnic groups.The distinct advantages of using BMI to assess body fat are that it is portable, noninvasive, and inexpensive; requires little training and little maintenance and operating costs; and is very precise . Other advantages of BMI are that it has available extensive national reference data, has established direct relationships with levels of body fat and with morbidity and mortality, and is highly predictive of future risk for overweight and obesity. Weight and BMI are useful in monitoring the treatment of overweight and obesity because they are sensitive to positive progress in response to treatment. Weight is easily monitored and tracked at home. One clear advantage for using BMI in adults is that height remains somewhat constant during most of adulthood, so longitudinal examinations based on BMI reflect mainly changes in weight.Limitations of BMI are that an increased BMI does not show which body compartment is inadequate and cannot differentiate subcutaneous adipose tissue from visceral adipose tissue. Another limitation is the accuracy of BMI in assessing body fatness for the individual . Measured body weight, height, and BMI are limited in accuracy; however, there is even greater concern related to self-reported estimates of these measures. Studies have shown that women and men, especially obese persons, tend to underreport their body weight and that men tend to overreport height . Underreporting weight and overreporting height lead to an underestimate of BMI and body fat. In summary, although BMI has its limitations, it remainsa simple measure to obtain and is used widely in large-scale studies, including international studies for long follow-up periods to assess disease risk.\n",

      "The third most commonly used field method to assess body fatness is based on skinfold measurements of the subcutaneous fat layer using inexpensive calipers. Skinfold thickness is as a body fatness predictor for two reasons: about 40 to 60% of total body fat is in the subcutaneous adipose tissue region of the body, and skinfold thickness can be directly measured using a wellcalibrated caliper. There are more than 19 sites for measuring skinfold thickness. The triceps site has been used more frequently than other sites because it is easy to access, is reproducible, and can measure wide differences among people. The skinfold technique involves pinching the skin with the thumb and forefinger, pulling it away from the body slightly, and placing the calipers on the fold. Thus, skinfold measures the thickness of two layers of skin and the underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue .To standardize skinfold measurements, guidelines for anatomical location of skinfold sites and measurement technique have been published . Four different calipers have been used: Adipometer, Harpenden, Holtain, and Lange. Lange is the most widely used. The calipers have been calibrated measuring ranges up to 60 mm. Interobserver error is a major issue in measuring skinfolds . Standardized methodology, including positioning of the instrument, a well-trained data collector, and practicing until results are consistent, can increase reproducibility. Special attention to locating the site, grasping the skin, and assuring that the caliper is at a 90 degree angle relative to the grasped skinfold are essential for high reproducibility.Due to its relative low cost and simplicity, the measurement of skinfold is a popular method of estimating body density; more than 100 skinfold prediction equations have been published. One of the most popular and widely used skinfold equations is that developed by Jackson and Pollock . This generalized equation was developed on a heterogeneous sample of 308 men ranging in age from 18 to 61 years and cross-validated on a similar sample of 95 men. The regression model was developed from the sum of seven skinfold sites . A high correlation was found between the sum of seven skinfold sites and the sum of three skinfold sites, so another equation using just three skinfold sites was developed . A similar model and generalized equations using the same sum of seven skinfold sites and a different set of three skinfold sites were developed from a heterogeneous sample of 249 women ages 18 to 55 years and cross-validated on a sample of 82 women .Because the skinfold method indirectly measures the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue, certain basic relationships are assumed . One is that skinfold is a good measure of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Hayes et al. showed a good relationship between mean fat thickness estimated from 12 skinfold sites and MRI. For men, the correlations between skinfold and MRI was significant. A second assumption is that the distribution of the fat subcutaneously and internally is similar for all individuals. The validity of this assumption is questionable. Older subjects have less subcutaneous adipose tissue than their younger counterparts. Also, lean individuals have a higher proportion of internal fat, and the proportion of fat located internally decreases as overall body fatness increases . Additionally, race could be a factor, with African Americans storing a greater percentage of total body fat internally compared to whites.A third assumption for the skinfold method is that a good relationship exists between subcutaneous adipose tissue and total body fat. It is estimated that SAT makes up one third of total fat . However, Lohman noted that subcutaneous adipose tissue can range from 20 to 70% of total body fat depending on such biological factors as age, sex, and degree of fatness. A fourth assumption is that a relationship is present between skinfold sites and body density. This relationship is linear for homogenous samples. A linear regression line will fit the data well only within a narrow range of body fatness values .The precision of the skinfold data has been shown to be highly variable and operator dependent. The accuracy of this method has been questioned when assessing body fat of the individual. The accuracy and precision of skinfold measurements are affected by the technician's skill, type of skinfold caliper, and subject factors . It is difficult, even for highly skilled technicians, to measure the skinfold thickness of obese individuals accurately. Often, the subject's skinfold thickness exceeds the maximum aperture of the caliper, and the jaws of the caliper may slip off the fold during the measurement. Therefore, skinfolds should not be used to measure body fat of obese subjects.In summary, the skinfold method requires a considerable amount of technical skill, being meticulous with site location and measurement, and restriction to populations from whom the prediction equation was derived. Although it is an excellent field method to use on lean subjects, it is difficult to obtain reliable and accurate readings on older subjects with less connective tissue or obese individuals with large folds. The availability of skinfold calipers capable of larger measurements would not be a significant improvement because of the physical difficulty of picking up a very large skinfold on an obese adult.\n",

      "The bioelectrical impedance method is widely applied in the field as a means of estimating fat free mass , total body water, and total body fat. Bioelectrical impedance is based on the premise that when a low-level electrical current is passed through the body at a fixed frequency , the voltage drop between two electrodes is proportional to the body's fluid volume in that region of the body. This, in turn, is used to estimate fat-free and fat masses. Bioelectrical impedance is based on the principle that lean tissue, which contains large amounts of water and electrolytes, is a good electrical conductor, and that fat, which is anhydrous, is a poor conductor. Therefore, the greater the total body water and fat free mass are, the less resistance to the flow of the electric current occurs.For healthy adults, the water content of fat free mass is relatively constant: 0.732 per kg . Thus, any measurement technique based on the assay for total body water indirectly provides an estimate for fat free mass. The body's percentage of fat can be defined as % fat = 100 × /wt. The voltage produced between two electrodes is measured with a BIA analyzer. Most bioelectrical impedance systems include body fat software based upon descriptive models. Two commonly used bioelectrical impedance analyzers are the RJL System and Vahalla Scientific .The biolelectrical impedance measurement is a relatively simple procedure. The subject lies supine on a nonconducting surface with arms and legs abducted at an angle of 30 to 45 degreesfrom the trunk. Source electrodes are placed at the wrist and at the ankle so that a weak alternating current undetectable by the subject can be passed through the body. The voltage drop is measured and the resistance calculated while the current is kept constant. The actual measurement procedure for the subject is relatively easy and can be performed within a few minutes. Resistance is recorded to the nearest ohm and used in prediction equations to estimate total body fat or fat free mass.A major source of error for the bioelectrical impedance method is intraindividual variability in whole-body resistance due to factors that affect the subject's state of hydration. Taking resistance measures 2 to 4 h after a meal decreases resistance and is likely to overpredict fat free mass by almost 1.5 kg . On the other hand, dehydration increases resistance, resulting in a 5.0-kg underestimate of fat free mass . The accuracy and precision of the bioelectrical impedance measurements are also affected by instrumentation, technician skill, subject factors, and environmental factors . Thus, the accuracy of bioelectrical impedance results and their interpretation should be used with caution . Another concern with bioelectrical impedance is that it is an indirect method and must be calibrated with a reference assay. The number of bioelectrical impedance calibration equations that have been developed is approaching the level observed for the skinfold method.In a review, Kushner reported the mean CV of multiple resistance measurements taken on the same subject in the same day ranges from 0.3 to 2.8%. When measured over days or weeks, intraindividual variability ranged from 0.8 to 3.6%. Kushner and Schoeller reported intraindividual variations in bioelectrical impedance measurements to average 1.3 and 2.2% for withinday and week-to-week measurements, respectively.bioelectrical impedance is an attractive method of body fat assessment because it is quick, relatively inexpensive, does not require a high degree of technician skill, yields results immediately, and does not intrude on the subject's privacy. However, because the bioelectrical impedance method is based on impedance to electrical current flow, the subject's state of hydration can influence the results; thus, strict guidelines for standardizing hydration levels prior to bioelectrical impedance testing need to be followed .Although the practical measurement of bioelectrical impedance is easy, a number of factors influence the measurements and, even after careful standardization of the measurement procedure, there remain factors for which one cannot easily control remain. One source of error is the distribution of body water between the intra- and extracellular spaces. Furthermore, body impedance depends on body and skin temperature, body posture during measurement, skin humidity , and whether the subject is in the fasting state or took strenuous exercise before the measurements. For all these reasons, prediction equations for body fat based on impedance are highly population specific and are clearly different between males and females and age groups . Using inadequate prediction equations can lead to high bias and, in lean subjects, often results in negative values for percent body fat. Changes in body fat have been studied by bioelectrical impedance and other techniques in many publications. The results are not consistent.\n",

      "Energy balance is the difference between energy intake and energy expenditure. If energy intake is greater than energy expenditure over a prolonged period of time, increases in body fat may occur. To measure energy balance, scientists and clinicians measure energy intake and expenditure via direct and indirect methods . Assessment of energy intake and expenditure is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, Chapter 2 discusses assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity in detail. Information beyond that presented in this chapter and Chapter 2 can be found in other peer-reviewed manuscripts .\n",

      "Physical activity has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer primarily because of its effects on steroid sex hormones. Physical activity also may influence breast cancer risk through its influence on energy balance, weight control, insulin sensitivity, and immune function. To date, at least 50 observational studies have been conducted to examine the association between some measure of recreational or occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. The majority of studies have observed an inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. In this chapter, we first consider the mechanisms that may account for lower breast cancer risk among physically active women and then review studies of recreational and occupational physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk. Finally, we comment on the importance of timing, frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity in determining breast cancer risk.\n",

      "Evidence exists that estrogen is critical in the development of breast cancer through increased proliferation of epithelial breast cells. In in vitro and in vivo studies, estradiol, considered the most potent and active form of estrogen, has been shown to increase mitotic activity of breast epithelial cells. By increasing mitoses, estrogens act to promote breast cell proliferation and thus increase the possibility of mutations, including those that are carcinogenic. Thus, cumulative lifetime exposure to estrogen is a key factor in determining a woman's breast cancer risk .During reproductive years, particularly during adolescence, high levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity have an impact on markers of ovarian hormone exposure, resulting in delayed menarche, increased likelihood of secondary amenorrhea and irregular or anovulatory menstrual cycles, and shortened luteal phases of the menstrual cycle; thus, physical activity is associated with reduced levels of estradiol, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone . In part due to the effects of physical activity, these factors would result in a reduction in lifetime ovulatory cycles and cumulative estrogen and progesterone exposure, therefore potentially reducing risk of breast cancer. Although the majority of early studies were conducted in athletes, increasing evidence suggests ovarian function also is altered in recreational athletes through lower mean hormone levels and longer anovular menstrual cycle length .After menopause, production of estrogen from the ovaries is negligible, resulting in a dramatic decrease of circulating estrogen levels compared to premenopausal women. Studies in normal weight women have shown that estrogen levels decline to approximately one-third of the lowest premenopausal levels . The main endogenous source of postmenopausal estrogen production is from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone in adipose tissue. Women who are physically active during their postmenopausal years have decreased levels of serum estrone, estradiol, and androgens that are precursors to estrogens . An association between physical activity and increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin also has been observed . However, the association between the various hormones and physical activity in postmenopausal women has not been as consistent as that found for premenopausal women, and several studies have found no clear association between hormone levels or urinary hormone metabolites and physical activity.Because aromatization of androstenedione to estrone takes place in fatty tissue, a larger amount of estrogen is produced by heavier postmenopausal women compared to thinner women . Consequently, obesity and weight gain are well-established risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer . High levels of physical activity have been associated with lower weight, lower BMI, and weight loss . Thus, the effects of physical activity in postmenopausal women may be due to direct suppression of hormone levels or indirect because physical activity affects body weight.\n",

      "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor -I have been implicated in carcinogenesis because they play a role in stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis . Increased levels of insulin specifically also may increase breast cancer risk because they have been associated with decreased levels of SHBG and, consequently, higher levels of free estradiol - that is, estradiol that is not inactivated through binding to SHBG . Some epidemiological studies support a positive association between insulin levels and breast cancer risk . High levels of insulin also are associated with decreased levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-I that may result in a higher level of unbound IGF-I .Insulin-like growth factor I also has been shown in vitro to act as a mitogen in breast cell lines and synergistically with estradiol to promote mitosis , and to play a role in promoting breast cell differentiation and transformation and in suppressing apoptosis . Epidemiological studies have suggested that high IGF-I levels are associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer .Two major determinants of insulin resistance are abdominal obesity and physical inactivity. Regular physical activity has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity and decreased levels of serum insulin, independent of its impact on body weight . Therefore, it may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Previous studies support a positive relationship between obesity and IGF-I levels , but current evidence does not allow clear conclusions to be drawn regarding a possible association between physical activity, independent of body weight, and IGF-I levels .\n",

      "Changes in immune function may also mediate the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Some researchers have observed that physical activity heightens immune response and may reduce risk of chronic disease by increasing production of natural killer cells that contribute to immune defense . This hypothesis is not specific to breast cancer, but would explain a protective role of physical activity in most cancers.The immune response hypothesis may be particularly relevant to breast cancer because recent evidence suggests that estrogen suppresses NK cell activity ; therefore, higher levels of estrogens and suppressed NK cell activity may interact to increase breast cancer risk in inactive women. Consequently, women who are physically active may be at a decreased risk of breast cancer because they have a higher production of NK cells as well as lower levels of estrogen. However, little work specifically has been done to define the role of immune function in breast carcinogenesis, particularly the potential mediation between immune function and hormones.\n",

      "To date, 16 prospective cohorts , 22 population-based case-control studies , and four hospital-based case-control studies have examined the relationship between recreational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Seven studies yielded more than one publication ; consequently, only the most recent report from each study has been used to reference each study. Additionally, a study by Enger et al. combined and analyzed subjects from two different previously cited studies and therefore was not considered as a separate study population.Overall, most studies suggest that physically active women have a lower risk of developing breast cancer than physically inactive women. A 20 to 80% reduction in risk with physical activity has been reported in 12 cohort studies ; 16 population-based case control studies observed a reduction in risk ranging from 20 to 70% and three hospital-based case control studies generally reported a 20 to 30% reduction in risk .The association between physical activity and breast cancer also is consistent across different populations and countries. Studies conducted in Australia , various countries across Europe , Asia , and the U.S. and Canada have reported an inverse relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Within U.S. studies, associations between physical activity and breast cancer were observed in multiethnic populations as well as specific subpopulations of white , black , Hispanic , and Asian-American women .In some studies, the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk also has been assessed separately for in situ and invasive breast cancer as well as estrogen/progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors. Although many previous studies include in situ and invasive breast cancer cases, only one study specifically examined the association between in situ breast carcinoma and exercise activity . In one additional study, researchers examined the association between physical activity and breast cancer stratified by stage of disease and found risk reduction to be greater for localized invasive disease compared to in situ or regional/distant breast cancer . Two studies also reported risk ratios separately for ER/PR positive and negative tumors, but neither found a difference in risk by ER/PR subtype .The impact of physical activity on age at breast cancer onset also has been examined in some previous studies . Physical activity, particularly in adolescence, was associated with significantly delayed onset of breast cancer in a case-only analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers . In the Adventist Health Study, Fraser et al. observed age of onset for breast cancer was approximately 6.6 years earlier for women who were inactive at baseline compared to active women .\n",

      "Questions regarding physical activity range from general questions such as \"Do you get much exercise in things you do for recreation?\" to very detailed reconstructed histories used in some case-control studies; these are based on lifetime calendars collecting information on duration, frequency, and intensity of physical activity that allow researchers to build exposure measures for different time periods throughout a woman's lifetime . Some studies also collected information on frequency of various activities, but lacked individual information on duration and/or intensity . In two other studies, physical activity was indirectly inferred through study design comparing athletes vs. nonathletes , or physical education teachers to language teachers . Some questionnaires only allowed for a limited number of activities to be reported for each time period , so activity histories in these studies may have underestimated the actual activity level of extremely active women.Summarv measures based on the available information from questionnaire data were then used to compare women with higher levels of physical activity to those with lower levels or who were inactive. In some instances, the level of detail was minimal; women were classified only as having little, moderate, or much activity . Other studies have collected the type of activity and hours per week of activity. In these studies, researchers have been able to examine activity level based on an intensity score, the metabolic equivalents of energy expended per hour of each individual activity . However, these MET values are assigned to every individual participating in an activity and do not consider individual variation in the intensity of the activity, a function of skill and effort. In general, the MET values used are derived from the Compendium of Physical Activities and this method of deriving MET-hours may result in misclassification of true energy expenditure.4614 ecreationa רייע איז אין אין אין אין אין דער איז אין דער איז אין דער רעדיקע בערע אין אין דער מען אין דער רעדן פרעזידער , p-tress 0.002; same ass sing MET scoreNo. of cases 332 704 pe of activi ecreation ecreation. veek of strenuo How activit measured requency of exercise at least 3 ictivity during eac ime period ommute to/fro work reslow 2001, U.S Author, date, and dams—Campbe 2001, U.S. uoto 2001, Finland egular adolescent a הידוש ביותר רוטי המדור היסטורים ריטי האירופי היטג מערים שנולדו שלו מוזיקים שנולדו שלו מוזיקים שנולדו של מערכת המטר מוזיקים שנולדו standing/walking 0.61 , trend < 0.01 ore = 1.07 /day eported up to fiv ceivities per time beriod, duration and length of ברי האירונג articipation in ach to calcula MET-h/day; ifetime Despite the variety of questionnaire approaches, the range of detail obtained, and the paucity of information on intensity of physical activities collected, most epidemiological studies have observed an inverse association between recreational physical activity and breast cancer risk. However, the amount of physical activity needed to lower breast cancer risk by a certain percentage remains unclear.The hypothesized biological mechanisms mediating an association between physical activity and breast cancer are based on observed physiological effects of moderate to vigorous exercise. However, no information is available regarding the direct physiological response to less intense activities. The effect of low-intensity activity is still unclear, but may be of importance - particularly for postmenopausal breast cancer - because a large portion of activity among postmenopausal and elderly women is not vigorous .Although previous studies have examined the association between leisure physical activity, such as walking, biking, swimming, and aerobics, not all studies have included the effects of other low-intensity activities, such as gardening, housework, or shopping, in their calculation of leisure physical activity; this may lead to an underestimation of true energy expenditure. A study examining the effect of retirement on leisure physical activity levels showed levels of recreational activity, including walking and household or gardening activity increased after retirement regardless of individuals' physical activity while they were working adults . Therefore, in studies of postmenopausal breast cancer, especially those including some retired persons, inclusion of activities such as gardening or other housework may be important when calculating leisure activity levels.Not only does the existing literature differ in the methods used to collect physical activity information, but studies also differ dramatically in the time frame of exposure. The time period of activity during a woman's life that is most important for predicting her breast cancer risk is still unclear because estrogen levels throughout a woman's life are key determinants of breast cancer risk among pre- and postmenopausal women. Lifetime recreational physical activity recording activity for every year of life , adolescent physical activity , and recent or baseline physical activity have been associated with lower breast cancer risk. Studies examining risk more broadly for specific decades of life also have observed an inverse association with specific or all examined time periods .Furthermore, studies have shown that even physical activity initiated after menopause can be beneficial in reducing breast cancer risk . Women who are active as adolescents and young adults are generally more likely to engage in exercise activities later in life than women who were never active ; thus, it has been an epidemiological challenge to examine risk in women who are only active at one point in time. Therefore, even though it appears that physical activity at various points during a woman's lifetime may reduce risk of breast cancer, the important time periods for predicting risk remain unclear.Epidemiological studies are also limited in their ability to measure lifetime or past physical activity without potential bias or misclassification of that past exposure because studies depend on the participant's ability to recall past activity accurately. Studies assessing the reliability of longterm recall of physical activity have shown that agreement between baseline and recalled activity was generally about 75% . Participant characteristics, such as age, race, education, body weight, and marital status, have been shown to have little association with quality of recall of past physical activity . The likelihood of recall bias has been minimized in many studies that have used validated lifetime calendars to aid study participants in recalling physical activity throughout their lifetime . In cohort studies, the inability to recall past activity levels accurately would most likely be nondifferential, biasing risk estimates toward the null value; however, few cohort studies have attempted to obtain any historical information regarding physical activity .\n",

      "Twenty-one observational studies have examined the relationship between occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Two studies yielded more than one publication ; consequently, only the most recent report from each study has been included in Table 4.1. An association of sedentary occupations with increased risk of breast cancer has been documented in reports from three of five prospective cohort studies. Published reports from six of eleven population-based case-control studies and three of four hospital-based casecontrol studies also document an inverse association between occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Finally, one retrospective cohort study documented an inverse association between high levels of occupational activity and breast cancer risk .Ten previous studies calculated a quasi-lifetime occupational physical activity score based on report of \"usual lifetime\" or \"longest held\" occupation and eleven studies calculated occupational physical activity based on study participants reporting multiple or all jobs held throughout their lifetime . Studies using a composite measure of lifetime physical activity based on the reporting of multiple or all jobs held more often observed an inverse association with breast cancer risk than did studies that utilized usual lifetime occupation . Using \"usual occupation\" to define lifetime occupational physical activity likely misclassifies and underestimates true lifetime activity levels, thus leading to a potential bias in risk estimates.\n",

      "Few risk factors for breast cancer are likely to be true confounders of the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer. Moreover, lifetime or historical measures of physical activity are likely to be unaffected by adjustment for recent diet, BMI, or other baseline factors because these factors are not generally related to activity at earlier time points. In studies of recent recreational physical activity, adjustment for potential confounding factors has not had a large impact on risk estimates .The most commonly hypothesized confounder of the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk is obesity; with the exception of a few studies , all studies of recreational physical activity adjusted for obesity using BMI. Most studies of recreational physical activity also have adjusted for other potential confounders, such as age, parity, family history, energy intake, menopausal hormone use, and alcohol intake. Studies of occupational physical activity were least likely to consider potential confounding factors . However, the association between physical activity and breast cancer has not been greatly attenuated by adjustment for potential confounding factors.Potential effect modification by various factors has been assessed in some previous studies. One may speculate that the influence of moderate levels of physical activity on hormone levels in women with a favorable estrogen profile may be sufficient to reduce risk. Women with higher levels of baseline circulating estrogens, such as women with a positive family history of breast cancer, current menopausal hormone users, or obese women, may not experience a reduction in risk with moderate physical activity. Women with higher baseline estrogen levels may require more vigorous and frequent activity to substantiate a reduction in risk.Results from two studies suggest that the association with physical activity may be stronger in women without a family history of breast cancer . Two previous studies also report a greater reduction in risk with increasing physical activity among parous women compared to nulliparous women ; however, two other studies documented the opposite finding, with risk reduction greater in nulliparous women . In four previous studies , researchers examined potential effect modification by menopausal hormone use, and one study suggests that physical activity may be more strongly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer in nonusers of menopausal hormones . In four previous studies, researchers examined effect modification by adult weight gain ; one study reported a greater reduction in risk among women who had less than a 17% increase in weight .Some studies documented a greater reduction in risk among leaner women compared to heavier women . In addition to the potential role of obesity as a confounder or effect modifier, there is the possibility that obesity may be on the causal pathway between physical activity and primarily postmenopausal breast cancer development. For example, physical activity around the time of menopause may reduce postmenopausal obesity and may subsequently prevent the initiation of malignant transformation of breast cells . However, most studies of physical activity and breast cancer adjusted for BMI, and an inverse association persisted; additionally, physical activity may have direct effects on circulating hormone levels independent of the impact on BMI. Thus, it is unlikely that the observed inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk is entirely explained by BMI. Differentiating among effects of confounding, effect modification, and factors in the causal pathway is an ongoing epidemiological challenge in examining the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk.Discrepancies in study results may be due to underlying differences in study population characteristics, a lack of sufficient statistical power to detect a true difference between subgroups, or chance. It should also be noted that the study publications reporting no effect modification have not provided details of analyses; therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether the failure to observe significant effect modification is due to a lack of sufficient statistical power.\n",

      "In summary, most previous observational studies observe an inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Risk appears to be reduced among women reporting physical activity at various points throughout their lifetime. The specific amount of physical activity necessary to infer a reduction in risk is not fully understood, but many previous studies suggest that 3 to 4 or more hours per week may be necessary to see an impact on breast cancer risk. Although the exact frequency, duration, and intensity are not well established, there is sufficient evidence that promotion of physical activity is an important modifiable factor for breast cancer risk.\n",

      "Physical activity has many dimensions, including frequency, intensity, and time. Each of these dimensions can be linked to activity performed at work, during recreation, or around the house. The amount of and intensity with which activities are performed may influence what is being measured in physical activity. The time period during one's life when activity levels are measured may have a further impact on associations.Early studies examining the association between physical activity and colon cancer focused on work-related activity , comparing those who were most active on the job to those who had lower levels of activity or who were sedentary. As the population transcended from one in which activity on the job was the norm to one in which it was the exception, questionnaires capturing self-reported physical activity became the primary mode of collecting physical activity data. These questionnaires usually differ in their focus on activities done at leisure, work, around the home, or pertaining to care of children and other adults - as well as in their ability to assess duration, frequency, and intensity of activities performed . Some questionnaires have gathered detailedinformation about various types of activity. Others have used more general questions, asking about limited activities and sometimes ignoring intensity of activities performed, and at other times neglecting to determine time involved in specific activities .In almost all instances, information on the benefits of continuous vs. cumulative activity and the number of days per week on which activities need to be performed to maximize protective associations have been lacking. The underlying biological mechanisms involved in the disease process and ability of questionnaires to capture these mechanisms may differ and thus influence investigator ability to detect associations with colon and rectal cancer.In addition to issues surrounding questionnaire design is the ability of study participants to recall activities performed accurately and to assign intensity levels to activities performed that are consistent with how others view and assign their activity levels . Attempts to test reliability and validity of physical activity data are limited, although activities performed at a more vigorous level of effort appear to be reported more consistently over time than activities performed at moderate levels of effort . It is possible that people who perform the same activities on a regular basis may be more likely to recall their activities than those who do many different activities less frequently.Associations between colorectal cancer and physical activity have been evaluated by metabolic equivalent tasks per week; energy expended per week; time spent in activity per week; and ranking individuals based on physical activity index scores that take all available activity data into account. Direct comparison of association between studies using the same measure of physical activity is not possible because of differences in methods used to assess and analyze physical activity. Despite this, associations between colon cancer and physical activity are remarkably consistent.\n",

Anatomic definitions of colorectal cancer tumor sites that are often used include: proximal ; distal ; and rectal . Differences in association by tumor site can stem from different study designs used to study associations; limited power to estimate associations when evaluating smaller subsets of data; or etiological differences in associations.Although many studies of colon cancer and physical activity have been conducted, fewer studies have examined all tumor sites. Thus, studies generally focus on colon cancer or rectal cancer, although some studies have attempted to estimate associations between physical activity and colon and rectal cancer. In a review of the literature , studies have been included that have at least 100 cases of colorectal cancer and have used questionnaires that have at least three physical activity questions.

Although a shift in the activity variable studied to describe the association over time has been observed, this shift most probably reflects changes in major sources of activity in the population as well as the need to better understand multiple dimensions of the physical activity and colon cancer relationship.Potential confounding, a bias that can distort the true association between physical activity and colon and rectal cancer, has been addressed by adjusting for a variety of factors in various studies. Confounding may be an issue because physically active people are thought to have healthier lifestyles and, possibly, lower rates of colorectal cancer. Some studies have adjusted only for age; however, others have adjusted for a variety of factors, including body size, diet, screening history, family history, smoking, alcohol use, and use of aspirin — all factors associated with colon and/or rectal cancer — and also may be associated with physical activity. However, studies that have adjusted for other components of a healthy lifestyle, such as not smoking cigarettes, eating a low-risk diet, and using aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, still observe the inverse association observed in other studies in which not all of these factors have been taken into account .Many early studies included cases of colon cancer as early as the 1950s and examined occupational activities, often comparing disease rates among individuals in agricultural or more physically active jobs to those of professionals or people who were more sedentary . These early studies almost uniformly demonstrated reduced risk of colon cancer. Early studies included little information on leisure activity, often because occupational data were from census records and information on activities performed at leisure was generally lacking. Associations between colon cancer and nonoccupational activity, as well as occupational activity, were reported by Slattery and colleagues in 1988 . This study was one of the first to report nonwork-related activities and to evaluate the impact of intensity of exercise on colon cancer risk. In this case-control study, participants were asked to report the number of hours spent in light, moderate, and intense activity for the 2 years prior to diagnosis or interview. Total physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer . Associations were strongest for intense activities among men .This study was one of the first to have the capability to adjust for other diet and lifestyle factors that could confound associations; associations remained after adjustment for dietary factors such as energy intake, protein, fiber, and fat. Also in 1988, Gerhardsson showed the beneficial effects of leisure-time activity and that total activity had a greater influence on risk than source of activity. In 1989, Severson also examined total activity and vigorous types of activities in conjunction with colon cancer in a cohort followed between 1965 and 1986; all indicators of activity were associated with reduced risk.Since these early studies, multiple studies have replicated these early results; most studies have shown approximately a 30 to 40% reduction in risk among the most active relative to those who are sedentary . Although the magnitude of the association has remained stable over time, the indicator of activity that is most importantly associated with colon cancer has varied. This change in indicator of activity associated with risk mirrors changes in activity patterns in the populations studied.Most studies have examined activity performed as an adult to assess associations; to evaluate temporal associations, the referent period is often the year or two prior to diagnosis of cases in case-control studies . In cohort studies, data often are collected at the baseline examination obtaining information near that time. Although some studies monitor changes in activities within the cohort, others depend on the baseline examination as the exposure and do not capture activity changes that may be associated with disease occurrence 12 to 15 years later. One study of activity performed during early adulthood did not find an association between physical activity and colon cancer . In Italy, the effects of physical activity performed at various ages was examined and showed the importance of activity performed at all ages, although the greatest protective effect came from occupational activity reported before age 50 .Long-term involvement in physical activity is an important discriminator of colon cancer risk and, in some studies, the best indicator of risk . This may imply that benefits come from long-term involvement in activity, although it is possible that those involved in physical activity throughout their life more accurately report their activity levels; therefore, estimates of association are less influenced by recall bias.974–1979 ഗ ້າ ສິ່ງ ບ ບ ບ ບ ບ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ ປ .6be by Wei is an expansion of previous reports by Gunenius and Rate in the includies and compare highest to bowset levels of activity, M = male; F =elsel by Wei is ar gomnino of perious reports hy Girenamis and RR form C studies and compare iglest o loves lovels of activit; follow-up\n",

      "Energy balance has been proposed as a key mechanism through which physical activity exerts its protective effect on colon cancer because energy expenditure, along with energy intake, is a key element in determining ability to maintain energy balance . Studies show that physical activity is associated with lower levels of obesity and abdominal obesity specifically . Effect modification or interaction, showing differences in association by different groups within the population, is one means whereby epidemiology can obtain insight into biological mechanisms. Evaluation of the interaction between physical activity and components of energy balance, such as energy intake and obesity, has been done to gain insight into the role of energy balance and how physical activity may modulate colon cancer risk through this mechanism. Studies have shown that people at greatest risk of colon cancer are sedentary with a large BMI and that the risk is greater than would be expected from each factor independently . Similar associations have not beenobserved for rectal cancer . Given the role of physical activity in modifying the harmful effects of obesity on colon cancer risk, physical activity may become even more important as the prevalence of obesity increases.It has been proposed that the influence of energy balance on risk of colon cancer may work through endogenous hormone metabolism . Of particular interest is how energy balance, in general, and physical activity, specifically, relate to insulin and insulin-like growth factors . It has been proposed that insulin and IGF may play a central role in development and promotion of colon cancers . Several studies have now shown that high levels of IGF-1 increase risk of colorectal cancer and that high levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 are associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer .In another study, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 increased risk of colorectal cancer, but IGFBP-1 was associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer; however, estimates of association were imprecise in that study . Studies have shown that high levels of physical activity are associated with increased insulin sensitivity, down-regulation of IGF-1, and up-relation of IGFBP-3 ; the exact intensity of the activity at which this down-regulation occurs is not clear. Epidemiological studies also suggest interaction between physical activity and glycemic load, a dietary factor thought to be associated with insulin .Genetic factors that have been proposed as being involved in an insulin-related pathway include insulin-like growth factor 1 , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 , insulin receptor substrate 1 , and insulin receptor substrate 2 . Polymorphisms of these genes have been identified; some of these have been shown to have effects on insulin resistance and/or diabetes. High serum IGF-1 levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and variation in serum IGF-1 levels has been associated with a CA repeat polymorphism 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site . High levels of IGFBP-3 have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer . An A/C polymorphism at nucleotide -202 is associated with different levels of IGFBP3 in a dose-response fashion, i.e., AA > AC > CC.The AC or CC genotypes would thus be predicted to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A Gly972Arg polymorphism in the IRSI gene has been associated with insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes; it might be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The G1057D IRS2 polymorphism has been associated with obesity and is therefore a plausible link to insulin resistance and colorectal cancer .Evaluation of physical activity with these genes has shown a significant interaction between physical activity and IGF1 genotype for colon cancer, a borderline interaction between IRS2 and physical activity level and risk of colon cancer. Those who were most physically active with the IGF1 1921192 genotype were at a significantly lower risk of colon cancer than those without this genotype. Low physical activity and high BMI appeared to have the greatest impact on risk in the presence of the IGFBP3 A allele .The vitamin D receptor 4 is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation and metabolic homeostasis . Some studies suggest that VDR also may be involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factormediated disease pathways ; others suggest that it may be important as a bile acid receptor. Examination of the Fokl VDR polymorphism showed that those who were least physically active were at greater risk of colon cancer if they had the ff VDR genotype .\n",

      "Given the associations between physical activity and colon, and possibly rectal cancer, it is possible that several biological mechanisms are involved. Given the lack of association between BMI and rectal cancer and inconsistent association between physical activity and rectal cancer, it is likely that mechanisms other than energy balance are operational - if, indeed, the association between physical activity and rectal cancer is real. Findings from controlled experimental studies generate most of the support for various proposed mechanisms, although assessment of interaction in epidemiological studies can provide clues to important mechanisms.The effect of physical activity on gastrointestinal transit time was the hypothesized mechanism put forth when the initial observation that physical activity decreased risk of colon cancer was made . It has been shown that people involved in moderate-level activities, such as walking, have a decreased gastrointestinal transit time, resulting in increased propulsion of colonic contents through the colon ; some studies suggest that more vigorous activity is needed for stimulation of the vagus nerve responsible for increased propulsion . Physical activity also is associated with reduced time that bile acids and other carcinogens are in contact with the GI tract. An interaction between colon cancer and fiber suggests that transit time may be an important mechanism .Physical activity has been shown to influence immune response . Natural killer cells and macrophages are important components of the immune system . Physical exercise is known to influence the activity of these cells consistently, with a twofold increase in their circulation immediately following intense activity . Regular exercise training has been shown to enhance the resting level of NK cell activity . Exercise also has been shown to influence levels of cytokines, soluble immune mediators produced by various immune cells. Interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor , and interlukin-6 are major cytokines that have been shown to vary by amount and intensity of physical activity performed in healthy individuals .Prostaglandins have been associated with tumor growth in studies of animals . Prostaglandin F, alpha inhibits tumor growth in the colon and increases gut motility; prostaglandin E, decreases colonic motility and increases the rate of colonic cell proliferation, especially in cancer cells 82]. Strenuous physical activity appears to increase levels of prostaglandin F, alpha and inhibit synthesis of prostaglandin E2 . Studies have shown that high activity was inversely associated with rectal mucosal prostaglandin E2 .\n",

      "Mutations in colorectal tissue are acquired over time, ultimately leading to a tumor. Although data are limited, evaluation of physical activity with other types of mutations in colon tumors can provide clues about specific disease pathways and how physical activity relates to these factors. For colon cancer, in one study, mutations p53, Ki-ras, and microsatellite instability have been examined with physical activity. Results suggest that p53 and Ki-ras mutations may be associated with physical activity . It appears that physical activity may be related to p53 mutations through its association with a Western diet ; for Ki-ras mutations, the importance of physical activity may be through its modifying effect on body weight . One study has examined physical activity with colorectal adenomas and has reported that more active people were more likely to have Kiras-negative than Ki-ras-positive tumors .\n",

      "Given the consistent association between physical activity and colon cancer, being physically active to reduce risk of colon, and possibly rectal, cancer is an agent of cancer prevention. In order to implement activity as a chemoprevention agent, it is important to understand how much activity is necessary, how often it should be undertaken, and how intense the activity should be to reduce risk. Most studies have not collected physical activity information that readily answers these important questions. The dose, or amount of activity needed, is often lacking, although estimates of dose can be made through examination of intensity and time, which are indicators of dose needed for protection. Dose-response has been reviewed in detail and is summarized here.Intensity of activity performed is one indicator of dose-response. More recent studies that have examined activities by intensity often show greater protection than moderate activity or total activity . Some studies report protective effects for moderate/vigorous activities, making it difficult to determine the independent effects of each. In a study by Slattery et al. , activities performed at a moderate and a vigorous level of intensity were associated with reduced risk of rectal cancer. To determine the impact of exercise intensity on risk, data were modeled to evaluate the effects of moderate and vigorous levels of intensity on colon and rectal cancer risk simultaneously. Results showed that vigorous activity remained significantly protective and that the association with moderate activity disappeared after adjustment for vigorous activity.The amount of time needed to reduce colon cancer risk is still debated. Because studies report associations differently, it is difficult to determine the amount of activity associated with reduced risk of colon or rectal cancer for some studies show significant protective effects at the upper tertile or quintile of activity and others have examined physical activity indices. Some report in MET minutes needed and others in hours of activity performed.Crude estimates of frequency and duration associated with reduced risk are shown in Table 5.3. These results focus on recreational or nonwork-related activity because that activity can be altered to reduce risk; however, work activity may add to the overall activity needed or explain some of the variation in risk observed between studies. Of importance is the observation that less intense activity requires a greater amount of time to see the same protective effect observed for intense activity at less time. This is illustrated in the study by Whittemore and colleagues in which the same level of risk reduction is assigned for 1 h of vigorous activity per day or 5 h of moderate activity per day.Similarly, in the studies by Martinez and Giovannucci , calculation of MET hours per week included activities performed at a moderate to vigorous level of intensity. Activities are given an amount of time corresponding to MET h/week. For instance, running for 1 h is equivalent to roughly 10.2 MET h; playing tennis for 1 h is equivalent to roughly 6 MET h, and 1 h of walking at a moderate to brisk pace is roughly equivalent to 3.2 MET h. Again, these show that the duration during which activities should be performed depends on the intensity of the activity. For instance, for running, 2 to 4 h per week of vigorous activity would be needed to see a protective effect and, if walking at a moderate to brisk pace, 7 to 14 h of activity per week may be needed.Taken together, recommendations based on studies in which data are available suggest that risk reduction occurs from performing somewhere around 3.5 to 4 h of vigorous activity per week; however, for moderate activity, 7 to 35 h of activity would be needed for the same risk reduction. The combination of intensity, duration, and frequency is a key element to the risk equation and therefore to any public health recommendation based on epidemiological data. A recommendation of about 3.5 to 4 h of vigorous activity per week, which translate to about 35 min of vigorous activity every day or 45 min of vigorous activity 5 days a week, may therefore be required to see a protective effect from physical activity on colon cancer risk.\n",

      "From existing data, it appears that sedentary people have a 60% to twofold increased risk of developing colon cancer; some evidence suggests similar associations for rectal cancer. Comparing physical inactivity to other risk factors for colon cancer, it has been have estimated that 13 to 14% of colon cancer in the population could be attributed to physical inactivity , which is comparable to estimates of 12% of colon cancer cases attributed to not using aspirin or NSAIDs and 12% of colon cancer cases attributed to eating a Western dietary pattern.On the other hand, only 8% of colon cancer cases could be attributed to a family history of colorectal cancer. The effects of physical activity on colon cancer risk are even greater when one considers the modifying influence of physical activity on risk of colon cancer associated with otherdiet and lifestyle factors . There are several possible mechanisms whereby physical activity may influence colorectal cancer risk; many of these appear to depend on frequency, duration, and intensity of the activity performed. Taken together, strong evidence indicates the importance of physical activity as a major factor in the etiology of colon, and possibly rectal, cancer. Public health policy that enhances the ability to increase physical activity patterns is warranted as a means of colon cancer prevention.\n",

      "Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates vary around the world with the highest rates observed in the U.S., Canada, and Scandinavia, and the lowest rates found in China and other Asian countries . These differences are attributable to variability in genetic susceptibility, exposure to external risk factors, and health care and cancer registrations . The incidence of prostate cancer increased rapidly in North America over the last 20 years; this was mainly attributable to the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen tests to screen for this disease, but has recently returned to levels observed prior to the introduction of PSA testing . Currently, prostate cancer incidence is the most common malignancy in men in the U.S. and Canada and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death among men .Prostate cancer etiology is still relatively poorly understood, with only a few established and several postulated risk factors . The main established risk factors are age, race , and family history ; possible risk factors include endogenous hormones , dietary intake , obesity , smoking , alcohol consumption , history of sexually transmitted diseases , vasectomy , and occupational exposures including cadmium, zinc, and pesticides . There is inconsistent epidemiological evidence for these postulated risk factors.Primary prevention strategies for prostate cancer include possible chemoprevention approaches with micronutrients because some epidemiological evidence suggests that prostate cancer risk is decreased with these dietary antioxidants. Other agents have also been proposed for pharmaceutical development, including inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-1 activity, because these two pathways may be involved in prostate carcinogenesis . Several large-scale prostate chemoprevention trials on selenium, vitamin E, and the 5-0 -reductase inhibitor, finasteride, are currently ongoing or have recently been completed . The PCPT trial demonstrated a 25% reduction in prostate cancer incidence among men taking finasteride in comparison to men in the placebo group. However, important adverse side effects occurred among men in the intervention group, including an increased risk for high-grade disease; thus, the efficacy of this agent for prostate cancer chemoprevention remains uncertain.Another modifiable lifestyle risk factor for prostate cancer that is receiving research attention is physical activity. Physical activity is an important means for the primary prevention of numerous chronic diseases, including cancers of the colon and the breast , and could potentially be an alternative to chemoprevention strategies for prostate cancer. The purpose of this chapter is to review the epidemiological studies on physical activity and prostate cancer risk, as well as to discuss the main biological mechanisms that may be involved in this putative association, the methodological issues that need to be considered for investigations on this topic, and future research directions in this area.\n",

      "A systematic review of the published literature through May, 2004, was conducted to identify all animal experimental and epidemiological studies that reported a measure of physical activity in relation to prostate cancer. To be included in this review, the studies needed to be examining physical activity as an etiological risk factor. No restrictions were made by language or year of publication. When multiple reports from the same study were found, the most recent and/or complete publication was chosen for inclusion into the review. The studies were categorized by type of study design and type of data collection methods and then reviewed systematically for the strength, consistency, dose-response, and coherence of the relation between physical activity and prostate cancer risk. The biological plausibility of this putative relation was examined separately by reviewing the literature on endogenous sex and metabolic hormone levels, immune function, and body size and prostate cancer risk. Methodological limitations with these studies were identified and considered as possible explanations for the differences observed across studies.\n",

Only the second publication by Steenland et al. will be included. An additional analysis on energy intake and prostate cancer from the Male Health Professionals Cohort Study, originally published by Giovannucci et al. , was published recently by Platz et al. . Because this most recent analysis only examined interactions of body size and physical activity, rather than the association of physical activity and prostate cancer risk, it is not included in this review. Finally, the paper by Ilic et al. was excluded because of the lack of information on the methods used in the study, including the physical activity assessment and the analytic approach. Thus, a total of 19 cohort studies and 12 case-control studies could be reviewed. Of the 19 cohort studies, 3 had prostate cancer mortality, rather than incidence, as the endpoint . Thus far, no studies have examined the association between physical activity and prostate cancer survival. One study has examined the association between physical fitness, in addition to the association with physical activity, and prostate cancer incidence and is included in this review.\n",

      "It would be of interest to know if the association between physical activity and prostate cancer varies by age at diagnosis, family history of prostate cancer, race, or other possible risk factors. Results specific to population subgroups are relevant for formulating hypotheses about the natural history of the disease and the possibility of influencing carcinogenesis during different susceptible periods, for designing and analyzing future studies, and for developing public health guidelines.For the studies reviewed here, there appeared to be more consistent prostate cancer risk reductions among physically active men in the European studies than in the American studies. Six of eight studies conducted in Europe found riskdecreases compared with only eight of twenty studies conducted in North America. Europeans have a wider range of recreational and occupational activities because their work is less mechanized and their lifestyles are more active than in North America. This difference in levels of physical activity is also apparent in the higher prevalence of obesity in the U.S. compared to European countries .Relatively few of these previous studies have attempted any type of subgroup analysis. Nine studies have presented results stratified by different age groups , ethnic and racial groups , or stage of cancer at diagnosis . No consistent subgroup effects have been delineated thus far for these factors. Giovannucci et al. did find a reduction in risk for metastatic prostate cancer cases only that was not found in any other stages of cancers examined in that study. The results for age have been inconsistent because a greater risk reduction was found among older men for combined occupational and recreational activity in the Norwegian cohort study , but the Hawaiian case-control study found an increased risk of prostate cancer among older men who had the highest occupational activity levels. In the one study that measured all activity from childhood to the reference period , some evidence for risk reduction for activity done in early life up to age 18 was found. The most physically active upper quartile of men experienced a 22%, nonstatistically significant decreased risk .The most recently published study also examined effect modification by additional risk factors, including body mass index , family history of prostate cancer, and alcohol intake . In that study, the only evidence for effect modification found was for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer risk for men with a prostate cancer family history in the highest quartile of activity compared to the lowest was reduced by 52%; those without such a history had no risk reduction . BMI was not found to be a risk factor or an effect modifier in this study . Effect modification in the association of physical activity and prostate cancer risk has not yet been adequately investigated.\n",

      "Only one cohort study, conducted by Oliveria et al. in the Aerobics Centre Longitudinal Study, assessed the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and prostate cancer risk. In that cohort, study participants' physical fitness levels were measured at baseline using a maximal exercise treadmill test. A 74% reduction was found in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of fitness level, with clear evidence of a trend across quartiles. Physical fitness is a complex construct that combines various personal physiological and genetic factors. It is correlated with physical activity but cannot be used interchangeably as a surrogate measure for physical activity. Physical fitness is, however, an objective measure that is less likely to be subject to recall bias or recall error. Although measuring physical fitness in epidemiological studies is logistically challenging and infeasible, these preliminary findings are noteworthy and suggest that additional investigations on physical fitness and prostate cancer risk could be worthwhile.\n",

      "One possible reason for the inconclusive and inconsistent results found in these studies arises from combining cases with different disease states or in combining men without disease into the casegroup. Only 2 of the previous 12 case-control studies attempted to address the issue of undetected prostate cancer in the control population and stage of cancer in the case population. The multicenter case-control study by Whittemore et al. included testing of PSA levels in the controls for most of the centers involved and staging of the cases into localized vs. advanced categories. The controls were stratified in the analysis into two groups, according to PSA levels taken shortly after the interview. The population-based case-control study by Friedenreich et al. included only stage T2 or greater cases in an attempt to make the comparison with the controls more valid by excluding any T1 cases that were incidentally detected.The results of the remaining case-control studies, as well as the cohort studies, were likely influenced by some misclassification of outcome among the controls because the prevalence of undetected prostate cancer among men in the age ranges relevant for prostate cancer incidence is about 20 to 40% . The effect of undetected cancer among the controls would be to bias the results towards the null. Thus, one possible explanation for the weak associations found in these studies could be the effect of differential misclassification bias.In studies that have been conducted since PSA tests for screening were commonly introduced , a number of lower stage prostate cancer cases could have been included in the case group because they were detected due to an elevated PSA level rather than because of clinical symptoms. Among the studies reviewed here, it was found that, on average, the more recent studies were less likely to show an effect of physical activity on prostate cancer risk than were the earlier studies.It was previously noted that Giovannucci et al. observed a risk reduction only among the metastatic cases. One explanation is that there has been outcome misclassification in recent studies that have not removed lower stage cases from the case group to ensure a more valid comparison with the controls. Because a large proportion of men have undetected, latent prostate cancer, the controls in these studies might have included cases unless some measure was taken to ensure that the controls were actually free of prostate cancer. It is also possible that men became cases solely because of elevated PSA levels detected through routine screening and that these incidental cancers would never have been clinically detected . Therefore, outcome misclassification is possible in the case and control groups because of the nature of prostate carcinogenesis and the methods used for its detection.\n",

      "Some of the inconsistencies observed in these investigations are likely attributable to the differences in the physical activity assessment methods used. The main problems include crude classification systems for physical activity, incomplete measurement of all the parameters of physical activity and all time periods of life, and the lack of validated and reliable instruments.An individual measurement of activity was made for some of the studies that measured recreational or occupational activity or leisure and work activity , but not for some of the occupational studies or recreational studies that used a group assignment of activity. Exposure misclassification could have occurred for the studies that used the job title as a measure for physical activity rather than an individual assessment of actual occupational activity performed.Only 9 of the 31 studies measured the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity directly from the study subjects. Two other studies combined information on frequency, intensity, and duration into a single measure of energy expenditure with intensitv assigned by the investigators based on available literature. It is currently still unclear what frequency, duration, and intensity of activity are required for a prostate cancer risk reduction or what combination of these components of activity will influence risk. For example, a certain intensity level may be necessary for physical activity to have an influence on prostate cancer risk via a biologicalmechanism that involves androgen hormones. Friedenreich et al. observed a 30% statistically significant risk reduction for vigorous intensity activity for men in the highest quartile of hours per week per year of all types of activity combined. No clear comparable pattern of risk reduction was observed when examining the association by frequency and duration only .The time period in a man's life when physical activity is most etiologically relevant has only been fully addressed in one study thus far . Because the prostate is a hormone-dependent organ that undergoes significant changes at different time periods in life, there may be particularly susceptible time periods when physical activity may have more influence on carcinogenesis. More studies are needed that measure activity and assess risk throughout a man's life before recommendations can be made regarding which time periods are most etiologically important for a risk reduction.\n",

      "Because the underlying biological model and mechanisms operative in the association between physical activity and prostate cancer are unclear, epidemiological studies need to incorporate and examine a wide range of possible confounders and effect modifiers. Possible confounding factors include diet and alcohol intake, socioeconomic status, smoking, ethnicity, family history of cancer, and, possibly, reproductive and medical factors . Possible effect modifiers are anthropometric factors, endogenous hormone levels, and age. Height has been shown to be a risk factor for prostate cancer but the data are inconsistent for BMI, waist-hip ratio, and weight . Height is influenced by genetic factors, but also by exposure before and during puberty to androgens that are also implicated in the normal development of the prostate gland. Physical activity may influence the level of endogenous androgens around the time of puberty through its influence on height and weight.Residual confounding may have influenced a number of the previous studies that did not assess confounding completely. Three of the epidemiological studies reviewed here did not adjust for any confounders ; five adjusted for age only ; 16 adjusted for some prostate cancer risk factors ; and seven studies measured and controlled for most of these risk factors .The main risk factor that was not measured and controlled for in the majority of the studies was dietary intake. The biological mechanism whereby dietary fat mediates an influence on prostate cancer risk is thought to be through endogenous hormones . Although the interaction of steroid hormones with the development of prostate cancer is poorly understood at present, studies have found that a low-fat, high-fiber diet decreases circulating testosterone . Physical activitymay also mediate prostate cancer risk through its influence on endogenous hormones and physically active individuals may have diets that differ systematically from inactive people; therefore, dietary intake is a key factor that needs to be measured and controlled for in epidemiological studies of physical activity and prostate cancer risk.Confounding by unmeasured and uncontrolled behavioral factors associated with being physically active may also explain, in part, the possible association between physical activity and prostate cancer risk. It is possible that individuals who are physically active are lean, generally healthier, and nonsmokers, seek medical care more readily, and generally exhibit other healthy behaviors that contribute to their observed reduction in risk of prostate cancer.Some of the discrepancies in the study results may be attributable to underlying differences in the characteristics of the subjects included. It is therefore important that future research studies examine the modifying effects of physical activity within defined strata of other prostate cancer risk factors, particularly because such analyses may provide insights into biological mechanisms. It would be useful to examine relationships by age, body size, body fat distribution patterns, and dietary intake - to name just a few of the major risk factors. Such analyses will need to ensure that adequate power exists for meaningful interpretations of the subgroup effects.\n",

      "Overall, previous epidemiological studies indicate that physical activity may decrease the risk of prostate cancer; however, the association is relatively weak and considerable inconsistency exists across these studies. Given this inconsistency and the lack of understanding of the precise role of physical activity in prostate cancer etiology, numerous questions remain to be answered. Research priorities can be categorized into research on: physical activity assessment methods; etiological studies; and biological mechanisms.The validity of different physical activity assessment methods needs to be improved and the reliability of these methods assessed. Future studies need to measure all types of physical activity and all components of physical activity across entire lifetimes. Direct measures of physical activity and fitness should also be included in addition to the subjective measures. New research on assessment methods should consider the underlying biological mechanisms in the design and evaluation of these tools.Additional etiological studies on a larger scale that measure activity appropriately and include complete assessments of confounding and effect modification are needed. For future prospective studies, repeat measures of activity and any confounders that may change over time, such as dietary intake, are needed so that information pertaining to all time periods being measured is available. A full assessment of confounders will also assist in distinguishing the independent role of physical activity as an etiological risk factor for prostate cancer separate from its contribution to a healthy lifestyle. Studies within different ethnic and racial groups are also needed, as well as studies that examine the risk by different stages of prostate cancer.Finally, additional research on the possible biological mechanisms for the role of physical activity on prostate risk is needed. At least five major mechanisms were reviewed here, including an influence of physical activity on endogenous hormones, energy balance, insulin-like growth factors, immune function, and antioxidant defenses. Experimental studies in animal and human models that examine how physical activity influences each of these biological mechanisms would provide important insights into the etiology of prostate cancer. These studies could examine how age, time of life, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of activity influence these different biological mechanisms. A better understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer would provide useful insights in the design and conduct of future etiological studies of physical activity and prostate cancer. In particular, possible surrogate endpoints that could be used as biomarkers of prostate cancer risk in future prospective etiological studies and intervention trials are also needed .\n",

      "Currently, the epidemiological evidence for an etiological role of physical activity in prostate carcinogenesis remains weak and inconsistent. Although several possible biological mechanisms can be hypothesized for this putative association, additional well-designed and appropriately conducted observational studies are needed to elucidate the nature of this association more completely before intervention research on the biological mechanisms would be justified. Prostate cancer remains an important cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among men and few modifiable lifestyle risk factors appear to be strongly associated with prostate cancer; thus, physical activity as a means for the primary prevention for prostate cancer merits further research consideration.\n",

      "One hypothesized mechanism explaining the association between increased physical activity and reduced risk for incidence of some cancers is the effect of physical activity on sex hormones . This is most relevant to certain hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and possibly prostate. Women with elevated concentrations of estrogens and androgens have increased risk for breast cancer , and those with elevated estrogen concentrations without counterbalancing elevated progesterone concentrations are at increased risk for endometrial cancer . Several cohort and nested case-control studies have examined the relationship between sex hormones and prostate cancer . The largest of these studies, a nested case-control study with 222 cases and 390 controls from a cohort of 22,071 U.S. male physicians found that men in the highest quartile of testosterone concentration were more than two times as likely as men in the lowest quantile of testosterone levels to develop prostate cancer .Events of early and late menstrual and reproductive life may be important in the induction or promotion of hormonally related cancers such as breast and endometrium. Early menarche , increased numbers of ovulatory cycles, late first birth or nulliparity, lack of lactation, and late menopause have each been found to increase risk of breast cancer from 20% to 100% . Increased number of lifetime ovulatory cycles and cyclic estrogen has been proposed as a significant risk factor for breast cancer . This chapter reviews the observational and clinical trial data linking physical activity to sex hormones in premenopausal women, postmenopausal women, and men.\n",

      "A small number of observational studies have reported on a link between physical activity and menstrual and reproductive factors including sex hormones. One reason for this lack of data is the challenge of timing of blood collection by day of menstrual cycle. This is relevant because the within-woman variability in the estrogen and progesterone concentrations over the menstrual cycle exceeds the between-woman variability of these hormones.Girls participating in vigorous sports such as ballet dancing and running experience a high incidence of primary and secondary amenorrhea, delayed menarche, and more irregular cycles compared with nonathlete girls . A cross-sectional study of 174 girls aged 14 to 17 years found that girls who expended 600 or more kcal energy per week were two to three times more likely than less active girls to have anovulatory menstrual cycles .In a sample of 636 women aged 20 to 44 years from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer study, several hormones were assayed and correlated with lifestyle and other factors . Women were regularly menstruating and had a most recent menstrual cycle of less than 40 days. The day of menstrual cycle was carefully recorded, and a subsample were assayed for progesterone at day 10 to -21 and for follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone at day -6 to -21. Physical activity was assessed by questionnaire and included data on physical activity at work and vigorous recreational exercise . After multivariate adjustment, including day of cycle, estradiol concentrations decreased with increasing amount of vigorous recreational exercise . Estradiol also decreased with increasing physical activity at work .Other studies suggest that recreational exercisers may have lower mean reproductive hormone levels and longer menstrual cycle lengths, although the individual effects of weight control and physical activity are difficult to discern .\n",

      "A handful of intervention studies have tested chronic exercise effect on menstrual factors or sex hormones in premenopausal women. Most have been very small; sample sizes ranged from 4 to 31 in five of the studies and one study randomized 132 subjects but only 57 completed the study. Thus, the information available from carefully controlled studies is scarce.In the largest published clinical trial, Bonen et al. randomized 132 women aged 18 to 40 years to one of six jogging exercise programs for 2 or 4 months: <10 miles/week; 10 to 20 miles/week; or 20 to 30 miles/week . There was no control group. Women were followed for nine menstrual cycles. Results were only presented for the 57 who completed the entire study. The researchers found no change in luteinizing hormone concentration, menstrual cycle length, or luteal phase length. Also, no trend was found toward increased change in follicle-stimulating hormone or progesterone with increasing physical activity. Body weight or percent body fat did not change, despite a significant increase in cardiovascular fitness in all study arms . The authors concluded that recreational running of up to 30 miles/week for four menstrual cycles had no deleterious effect on menstrual cycle. This study had the benefit of a randomized design with long follow-up. The considerable dropout rate , however, limits the interpretation of study results.Investigators in Boston published two reports from a randomized clinical trial of weight loss vs. weight maintenance in 31 untrained college-aged women . All women received the same exercise prescription of 10 miles/day running plus 3.5 hours/day of sports. All activities took place during 8 weeks at a college training camp. Food intake was carefully prescribed and controlled by camp dieticians. Overnight urine was collected daily. During the intervention, 18 women developed loss of luteneizing hormone surge , 13 experienced delayed menses, and 18 developed luteal phase defects. In the weight-loss arm, 75% of the women had delayed menses vs. 8% of women in the weight-maintenance arm . Similarly, 81% of women in the weight-loss arm experienced loss of luteneizing hormone surge vs. 42% of women in the weight-maintenance group . Incidence of luteal phase defects between the two groups did not differ. All subjects were experiencing normal menstrual cycles 6 months after termination of the intervention. The authors interpret their study as suggesting that vigorous exercise, especially in conjunction with weight loss, can result in reversibly disturbed reproductive function.In a very small study, four women aged 25 to 29 years were assigned in random order to one of three conditions of 1-week duration during the early follicular phase of the cycle: control, exercise, and exercise with energy restriction . Women were followed for three menstrual cycles. Exercise alone had no effect on luteneizing hormone pulse frequency, level, or peak amplitude. However, diet plus exercise caused a decrease in luteneizing hormone pulse frequency compared with control condition and exercise alone .In a later study by Williams et al., 15 women were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sedentary control, active control , training during follicular phase of menstrual cycle, or training during luteal phase of the cycle . The training consisted of twice daily running or cycling for five days/week. The exercise bouts consisted of running 3.2 km per exercise bout increasing by 1.2 km/bout each week. The training lasted through two menstrual cycles. Diet was controlled to maintain weight within ±2 kg of baseline weight. At the end of the intervention, almost half of the trained women showed evidence of abnormal luteal function, including short luteal defects and low urinary progesterone. None experienced loss of luteneizing hormone surge, and none had delayed menses or abnormal bleeding. The changes in luteal function were observed in both training groups, suggesting that exercise at any time in the cycle can affect menstrual function.In the HERITAGE Family Study, parents and their adult sons and daughters completed a 20week endurance training program on cycle ergometers . On average, sex hormone-binding globulin increased 3.4 nmol/L in the daughters but decreased an average 7.9 nmol/L in their premenopausal mothers .A high-intensity exercise intervention in 28 untrained college women with normal ovulation and luteal adequacy resulted in reversible abnormal luteal function in two-thirds and loss of luteinizing hormone surge in over half of the subjects . The most marked disturbances were observed during the periods of most intense training and in women who had been randomized to a weight-loss group.Although exercise effects on menarche, menstrual cycle characteristics, and endogenous sex hormones in girls and young women is often cited as a potential mechanism relating exercise to breast cancer risk, the existing evidence comes from inadequately powered intervention studies, many of which were not randomized clinical trials. Data are still lacking on the requirements to produce menstrual and hormone effects, including the amount, frequency, and type of exercise needed; the age at which a girl or woman needs to begin exercising; whether body mass and body fat must be kept low; and what type of dietary pattern is optimal. Data from primate animal models strongly suggest that negative energy balance is responsible for physical activity effects on menstrual cycle characteristics and sex hormones in reproductive years .\n",

      "Increased physical activity measured through self-report and by movement monitors has been found to be associated with decreased serum concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and androgens after adjustment for body mass index in postmenopausal women in some but not other studies. Increased physical activity is also associated with increased circulating concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin in women , which competitively binds to estrogens and androgens, resulting in lower amounts of free, active hormones in the circulation.\n",

      "The effect of a 1-year moderate intensity physical activity intervention on the endogenous sexhormone profile of postmenopausal women was tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial in Seattle, Washington . Women were eligible if they were aged 50 to 75 years, not using sex hormones, sedentary, nonsmokers, willing to be randomized, had no endocrine-related disease or cancer, had a body mass index greater than 24.0 and a percent body fat of 33.0 or greater. Subjects were recruited through mass mailings, supplemented with media placements.A total of 173 women was randomized to a 1-year moderate intensity aerobic and strength training physical activity program or a control program . The aerobic exercise intervention consisted of thrice weekly exercise sessions at a study facility and twice weekly home exercise sessions. The facility aerobic exercise sessions consisted of 45 minutes of endurance exercise at 70 to 85% of maximal heart rate. Home exercise sessions consisted of aerobic exercises of the women's choice. All 173 women provided blood at 3-months follow-up, and 170 provided blood at 12-months follow-up. On average over the 12 months, the exercisers participated in moderate-intensity sports/recreational activity for a mean 3.7 ± 1.4 days/week for a total of 171 ± 87.9 minutes/week . Six exercisers dropped out of the intervention . On average, cardiorespiratory fitness increased in exercisers by 12.7% and in controls by 0.8% .At 3 and 12 months, women in the exercise group experienced 3.8 and 1.8% declines in estrone, respectively, compared with increases of 3.4 and 3.9% in controls . Exercisers experienced a 7.7% decline in estradiol at 3 months, compared with a decline of just 0.6% in controls ; at 12 months, the decline in exercisers was present but attenuated. Sex hormone-binding globulin increased from baseline to 3 and 12 months in exercisers to a larger degree than controls, but the differences were of only marginal statistical significance. Exercisers had an 8.2% decrease in free estradiol from baseline to 3 months, compared with no change in controls . At 12 months, the decline in estradiol in exercisers was slightly less than at 3 months.Figure 7.1 to Figure 7.3 show the exercise effects on estrogens by change in body fat. Among the exercisers who lost more than 2% body fat, concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol decreased by 11.9, 13.7, and 16.7%, respectively, at 12 months. In contrast, among the controls who lost body fat, concentrations of estradiol and free estradiol increased and estrone decreased by just 3.6%. Comparisons of these changes between exercisers and controls for those who lost body fat were statistically significant for estradiol and free estradiol.Women in the exercise and control groups experienced similar, nonsignificant declines in testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandiosterone , and dehydroepiandiosteronesulfate from baseline to 3 and 12 months, so the comparison of change over time between exercisers and controls was not statistically significant . Exercisers experienced a 6.5% declineFigure 7.4 and Figure 7.5 show the exercise effects on androgens by change in body fat. At 3 and 12 months, androgen concentrations decreased to a greater extent among exercisers who lost at least 0.5% body fat vs. exercisers who did not lose body fat. Among women who lost between 0.5 and 2% body fat, exercisers' testosterone declined by 1.5 and 4.7%, respectively, at 3 and 12 months; in controls, it did not change at 3 months and declined by only 2.8% at 12 months . Among those who lost more than 2% body fat, exercisers' testosterone declined by 10.1 and 8.0%, respectively, at 3 and 12 months, and in controls it declined by only 1.6 and 3.6% .Among women who lost between 0.5 and 2% body fat, exercisers' 12-month free testosterone declined by 10.4%, but in controls it declined by only 4.3% . Among those who lost more than 2% body fat, exercisers' 12-month free testosterone declined by 12.2% and by only 8.0% in controls. Although not statistically significant, exercisers vs. controls who lost more than 2% body fat had greater 12-month changes in androstenedione , DHEA , and DHEAS .As previously reviewed, human estrogen metabolism is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes . Two of the major hydroxylated metabolites of estrone are 2-hydroxyestrone and 1602-hydroxyestrone . These metabolites are produced by competing pathways and have different properties. 2-OH E; is weakly estrogenic; in vitro studies and animal models have suggested that it is anticarcinogenic. In contrast, 160 -OH E, is more estrogenic, has been shown to form covalent bonds with estrogen receptors, and may be genotoxic. One hypothesis is that urinary excretion of these estrogen metabolites can be used as a risk marker for breast cancer. Some but not all epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of breast cancer associated with low urinary excretion of 2-OH E, relative to 16α-OH E ..In the clinical trial described earlier , the effects of a 12-month moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention on urinary 2-OH E., 160-OH E., and their ratio in postmenopausal women were determined. Urinary 2- and 16α-OH E, were measured in spot urines collected at baseline, 3, and 12 months. Overall, no significant effects of the exercise intervention on 2-OH E1, 1602-OH E1, or their ratio were found.Analyses are under way to determine the effect of various genetic polymorphisms related to hormone production and metabolism on the effect of exercise on sex hormones in the Physical Activity for Total Health Study. As described in Chapter 12, the Alpha Trial under way in Alberta, Canada is testing a similar exercise intervention to the Physical Activity for Total Health Study in over 300 postmenopausal women.\n",

      "Physical activity may affect sex hormone concentrations in women and men - directly via effects on trophic organs and indirectly via physical activity effects on adiposity, a substrate for estrogen and testosterone production. This nonsex-organ hormone production can result in excessive amounts of circulating and tissue hormone, which can affect the process of carcinogenesis in women and in men.Because of the paucity of randomized controlled trial data, it is not yet established that change in physical activity can affect sex hormone concentrations independently of an effect of physical activity on adiposity. How much physical activity or what type would be needed to change hormones is also not clear. Additionally, the separate and combined effects of physical activity, diet patterns, and adiposity are not known. Future research should address these issues in randomized controlled trials, preferably with separate and combined physical activity and dietary interventions in a single trial. Future research should also assess the effects of physical activity on sex hormones in women and men from various races, ethnicities, ages, and geographic areas. Also, the role of genetics in modifying the effects of physical activity on sex hormone concentrations should be explored.\n",

      "According to the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer Prevention, it is recommended that individuals be physically active. Similar to recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society recommends that individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight by being moderately active for at least 30 min on 5 or more days per week to reduce the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes . In addition, although it is not fully understood why physical activity may play an integral role in the management and survival of cancer, it has been shown that regular physical activity can reduce fatigue and anxiety in cancer patients and improve quality of life . Exercise may also improve the lean body mass-to-fat mass ratio, increase range of motion and stability, and promote stress reduction in cancer patients and survivors.Research in this area has shown that exercise may improve known risk factors for several chronic diseases. The focus of this chapter will be on elucidating potential underlying mechanisms by which physical activity can decrease the risk of several chronic diseases, including several cancers - namely, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia . Some evidence indicates that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may play roles in increasing the risk of several cancers, including breast , colorectal , pancreas , endometrium , and stomach . In addition, studies have shown elevated serum insulin concentrations in individuals with cancer but void of other diseases related to hyperinsulinemia , and impaired glucose tolerance has been found to be an independent predictor for cancer mortality .Expanded molecular-based research examining the relationship between exercise and insulin resistance has been reported. Researchers have shown that physical exercise has the ability toenhance insulin sensitivity as well as decrease levels of insulin and bioavailable insulinlike growth factor -1, both of which enhance division of normal cells and inhibit cell death . There is also clear evidence that regular exercise reduces insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia . However, not all studies have shown that exercise can have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity .\n",

      "Obesity and overweight are defined as having a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m² and 25 kg/m², respectively . Results from the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , using measured heights and weights, indicate that an estimated 64% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese . This represents a prevalence approximately 8% higher than the age-adjusted overweight estimates obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III . Nearly 59 million American adults are obese, and the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled in the last 20 years. Of Americans aged 6 to 19 years, 15% are overweight . According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 200 million obese adults worldwide and another 18 million children under age 5 classified as overweight as of 1995. However, as of 2000, the number of obese adults increased to over 300 million. Crude projections, from extrapolating existing data, suggest that, by 2025, levels of obesity could be as high as 45 to 50% in the U.S.; between 30 and 40% in Australia, England, and Mauritius; and over 20% in Brazil .Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with an increased risk for type-2 diabetes , coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke , and several cancers . Epidemiological studies have shown positive associations between various measures of overweight and adiposity and a variety of cancers. The International Agency for Research of Cancer concluded that a moderate to strong association exists between increased body weight and increased risk of colon, kidney, esophagus, endometrium, thyroid, and postmenopausal breast cancer . In addition, the International Agency for Research of Cancer has estimated that between one-fourth and one-third of cancer cases may be attributable to the combined effects of elevated body weight and inadequate physical exercise. Other obesity-related chronic diseases include hypertension, osteoarthritis, and gallbladder disease and the number of comorbidities is highly correlated with the rise in body weight. For example, a BMI above 35 kg/m² is associated with a 93-fold and 42-fold increase in the risk of type-2 diabetes in women and men, respectively. With a 20% rise in body weight the risk of coronary heart disease is increased 86% in men and 360% in women .An inverse association between physical activity and body weight has been reported in several cross-sectional epidemiological studies . Furthermore, several large-scale prospective observational studies have shown that higher physical activity has resulted in an attenuated weight gain or lower odds of significant weight gain . Evidence suggests that regular physical activity plays a greater role in attenuating age-related weight gain, rather than promoting weight loss . The amount of physical activity needed to prevent weight gain or to lose weight is unknown. The American College of Sports Medicine and Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDue to several variables, such as the individual's body weight, nutritional status, and principles of training such as the frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise, it is difficult to measure adequately the amount of physical activity required to promote weight loss. However, several studies have supported the role of physical activity in the promotion of weight loss and weight maintenance . A meta-analysis including 28 publications concluded that aerobic exercise without dietary restriction among men caused a weight loss of 3 kg in 30 weeks compared with sedentary controls and 1.4 kg in 12 weeks among women . In addition, physical activity has favorable effects on reducing insulin resistance among obese subjects .\n",

      "From 1980 through 2002, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled . This shows an increased prevalence compared to data from the NHANES III , which estimated that diagnosed diabetes was 5.5% for U.S. adults , or 10.2 million people when extrapolated to the 1997 U.S. population. Using the 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 2.7% and the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose was 6.9% . Using the new minimum criterion for impaired fasting glucose from 100 mg/dl to 125 mg/dl , the total prevalence of impaired fasting glucose using the NHANES 1999–2000 dataset would increase from 6.9 to 24.1% . In addition, the worldwide prevalence of type-2 diabetes is estimated to be around 120 million people and has been predicted to almost double to 215 million people by the year 2010 [501.The pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes involves defects in insulin action and secretion manifested by several characteristics, including impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. In addition, the insulin resistance syndrome is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia , and, by some definitions, high urate concentrations . Insulin resistance has also been correlated with several inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, interleukin receptor agonist, and C-reactive protein . Risk factors for the development of type-2 diabetes include increased age, minority ethnicity, family history, prior history of gestational diabetes , increased overall obesity , increased intra-abdominal fat distribution , and lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity , diet, and parity .Several epidemiological studies have determined that regular physical exercise can reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes and modest changes in diet and physical activity have been shown to decrease this risk by 58% . In addition, a prospective study of 5159 men aged 40 to 59 years with an average follow-up period of 16.8 years found that a moderate level of physical activity was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of hyperinsulinemia, a 30% reduction in the risk of hypertriglyceridemia, and a 25% reduction in the risk of low HDL cholesterol . A single exercise bout has been found to improve insulin resistance among those with type-2 diabetes ; however, 7 consecutive days of exercise and not a single bout of exercise were needed to improve insulin resistance in some subjects . According to the American College of Sports Medicine's position regarding exercise and type-2 diabetes, individuals should strive to achieve a minimum cumulative total of 1000 kcal/week from physical activities . In addition. because high-intensity exercise has been shown to increase blood glucose concentrations 1741 and insulin resistance in some patients, low- to moderate-intensity exercise is recommended for many diabetics .\n",

      "The pathogenesis of insulin resistance is multifaceted. Major causes of acquired insulin resistance include aging, genetics, pregnancy, lack of physical activity, and obesity . Furthermore, several hormones and regulatory factors affect insulin action and may contribute to insulin resistance, especially that observed in obesity. These include chronic hyperglycemia and increased free fatty acids . Several molecular, intracellular, and systemic mechanisms of action occur during and after exercise to attenuate chronic disease risk due to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. In addition, lifestyle factors, including physical activity and physical inactivity, may stimulate the expression of several genes at multiple levels ; these, in turn, may affect insulin resistance .Skeletal muscle is a major site of insulin resistance and involves dysregulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism . In the exercising muscle, the increased need for metabolic fuel is met partially through an increase in the uptake and utilization of glucose . The degree of glycogen depletion resulting from prior exercise or caloric depletion is an important factor in determining the rate and duration of the increase in muscle glucose uptake during and after exercise . Glucose transport in skeletal muscle occurs primarily by facilitated diffusion utilizing glucose transporter carrier proteins. The major glucose transporter protein expressed in skeletal muscle is the glucose transporter type-4 . It has been shown that the insulin resistance in skeletal muscle results from alterations in the translocation, docking, or fusion of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane or the T-tubules, or potentially from changes in the specific activity of the transporters. Physical training increases muscle GLUT4 protein and mRNA in individuals with type-2 diabetes, as well as in healthy subjects .Insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation is an important intermediary step in the process of GLUT4 translocation, and alterations in insulin-receptor substrate 1 or other insulin receptor substrates have been postulated to play a role in insulin resistance . Animal models have shown that exercise leads to increased expression and function of several proteins involved in insulin-signal transduction and differential responses of insulin-receptor substrates 1 and 2 . Normally, after stimulation by insulin, insulin-receptor substrate 1 serves as a docking protein that facilitates phosphorylation of other intracellular proteins such as phosphatidylinositol kinase . Phosphatidylinositol kinase may be an important effector in the pathway by which GLUT4 transporters are inserted into the plasma membrane. Insulin-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase has been shown to be impaired in skeletal muscle in humans with obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus .Interestingly, several studies have shown that exercise and insulin stimulate glucose uptake through distinct mechanisms and research has shown that insulin and exercise recruit GLUT4 from two distinct intracellular storage sites in skeletal muscle . Insulin utilizes a phosphatidylinositol-kinase-dependent mechanism, whereas the exercise signal may be initiated by calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or from autocrine- or paracrine-mediated activation of glucose transport . Furthermore, insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle involves many proteins that are not involved in exercise-stimulated GLUT4 translocation .Bierman et al. first reported that plasma free fatty acids were elevated in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and subsequent studies have extended these findings to include nondiabetic insulin-resistant individuals, obese patients, and first-degree relatives of type-2 diabetic patients . Elevated free fatty acids have been shown to produce insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner acutely and chronically , and plasma free fatty acid concentrations correlate with the degree of hyperglycemia, skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and the risk of developing type-2 diabetes . Elevated free fatty acids have been shown to alter insulin signaling , abolish the increase in insulin-receptor substrate 1-associated phosphatidylinositol-kinase, and decrease the concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate within the skeletal muscle, indicating direct inhibition of glucose transport/phosphorylation .Exercise acts to interfere with the synthesis of fatty acids at the molecular level. More specifically, exercise, through hormonal and sympathetic nervous system control, promotes the stimulation of cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase. In turn, AMP-activated protein kinase causes the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. Normally, acetyl CoA carboxylase promotes the first step in the synthesis of fatty acids and generates malonyl CoA . Importantly, malonyl CoA is a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, an enzyme required for lipolysis. It has been shown that exercise decreases insulin resistance due to its ability to lower malonyl CoA concentrations within the cell . In effect, therefore, exercise may divert the flow of fatty acids toward mitochondrial oxidation, leading to improved insulin signaling . Furthermore, enhanced fat oxidation through physical activity has been shown to be associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity in obese individuals .Several other molecular and genetic mechanisms have been proposed in the attenuation of insulin resistance due to exercise. Individuals with insulin resistance may have altered gene expression of several enzymes involved in energy homeostasis within the skeletal muscle, including hexokinase II, phosphofructokinase, and glycogen synthase . Decreased muscle glucose transport/phosphorlyation, as indicated by decreased intramuscular concentrations of glucose-6phosphate, has been shown to be lower in the offspring of individuals with type-2 diabetes . Furthermore, decreased muscle glycogen synthase mRNA concentrations and decreased activity and activation of muscle glycogen synthase in patients with type-2 diabetes, as well as their insulin-resistant relatives, have been shown . A single bout of exercise training has normalized glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in these subjects; however, glycogen synthase activities remained low compared to those of nontype-2 diabetic subjects . In contrast, glycogen synthase activity has been shown to be increased immediately after 60 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling exercise in trained, healthy subjects, and the training effect upon glycogen synthase activity was abolished after 5 days of inactivity . These results suggest differences in glycogen synthase-exercise responses between normal individuals vs. individuals with type-2 diabetes, as well as their offspring, and that increases in glycogen synthase activity may depend upon the duration and frequency of exercise training. In addition, exercise has been shown to affect signaling cascades related to glycogen synthase activity - namely, c-Jun NH2terminal kinase and p38 kinase .In summary, exercise increases insulin sensitivity through a variety of molecular pathways. Several other mechanisms have been proposed that have not been included here. For more detailed information, other resources should be sought .\n",

      "A distinction should be made between the acute effects of exercise and genuine training effects. However, the acute and persistent effects of exercise on glucose uptake and glycogen metabolism have important implications for individuals with insulin resistance , and acute bouts of physical activity can favorably change abnormal blood glucose concentrations and insulin resistance . The time period after exercise is characterized by increased muscle sensitivity to the actions of insulin . A single bout of moderate to strenuous exercise can markedly increase rates of wholebody glucose disposal and increase the sensitivity of skeletal muscle glucose uptake to insulin . even in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus . Up to 2 h after exercise. glucose uptake is, in part, elevated due to insulin-independent mechanisms, probably involving a contraction-induced increase in the amount of GLUT4 associated with the plasma membrane and T-tubules of the skeletal muscles .As reviewed earlier, acute exercise enhances insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and increases muscle GLUT4 protein content, and the depletion of muscle glycogen stores with exercise plays a role in these mechanisms. Due to differences in methodology , body composition of subjects, and energy homeostasis, it is unclear how long the salutary effects on glucose homeostasis from an acute bout of exercise remain. In addition, insulin sensitivity and/or insulin responsiveness may be different after an acute exercise bout in trained vs. untrained individuals ; these effects may be modified by age .Henriksson has reported that insulin sensitivity increases with a single exercise session in the young, but that several training sessions are needed to increase insulin sensitivity in middleaged to older subjects. This researcher also reported that these transient increases in insulin sensitivity disappeared within 3 to 6 days. In moderately trained, healthy men, improved glucose homeostatic mechanisms were observed 12 to 16 h after exercise, but these improvements disappeared within 5 days of inactivity following 5 days of moderate aerobic exercise . In one study, trained subjects were compared with untrained subjects undergoing an acute bout of exercise and trained subjects were compared before and after 5 days of detraining ; an increase in maximal insulin action on whole-body glucose uptake but not insulin sensitivity has been shown to be a long-term adaptation caused by endurance training.The effects of long-term physical training seem to be beneficial in the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance . During exercise, skeletal muscle utilizes more glucose than when at rest. However, endurance training leads to decreased glucose utilization during submaximal exercise, in spite of a large increase in the total GLUT4 content associated with training. The mechanisms involved in this reduction have not been totally elucidated, but endurance training appears to cause a decrease of the amount of GLUT4 translocated to the plasma membrane by altering the exercise-induced enhancement of glucose transport capacity. Several studies have shown that trained individuals have smaller increases in plasma insulin concentrations in response to a glucose load than do sedentary counterparts and, in spite of this lower insulin response, have unchanged or improved glucose tolerance . Concentrations of amino acids, growth hormone, or catecholamines do not change for these individual which might account for the insulin decrease. Cortisol is decreased days after an acute exercise bout as well as after training, in parallel with the plasma insulin decrease. The cortisol decrease may result in changes in insulin-receptor density in tissues, leading to increased insulin sensitivity. The insulin decrease seems to be due to decreased production and increased clearance .Training without compensatory increase in caloric intake leads to diminished body fat and increases in lean body mass. However, these changes are not obligatory for the plasma insulin decrease. Even studies that have controlled for these effects detect an improvement in insulin sensitivity due to exercise . Therefore, exercise appears to improve insulin action independently of changes in body composition. Studies have shown improvement in insulin sensitivity with physical exercise despite no changes in body weight or body composition - or even increases in overall body fat - when compared to nonexercising controls . A metaanalytical study reviewed and quantified the effect of exercise on glycosylated hemoglobin and body mass in patients with type-2 diabetes and concluded that significant decreases took place in postintervention glycosylated hemoglobin with no differences in body mass between intervention and control groups.In conclusion, the effects of exercise training could be explained, in part, by the residual effects of the last session of exercise , but it could also be explained by long-term up-regulation of the number and function of glucose transporters , capillary proliferation , and the number of oxidative muscle fibers, which are more insulin responsive . Clearly, there is a combination of several factors whereby acute and long-term exercise can decrease hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Therefore, physical training can be considered to play an important, if not essential, role in the treatment and prevention of insulin insensitivity .\n",

      "Studies have shown an increased incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus in relation to abdominal obesity . Increased abdominal adiposity, even despite a normal body weight, is associated with increased cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes risk, in part by the concomitant increases in hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance . Abdominal fat, or central adiposity, is more metabolically active than peripheral adiposity and may therefore confer greater risk of some diseases than fat deposited elsewhere . Furthermore, visceral adipose tissue has been shown to be an independent correlate of glucose disposal in obese postmenopausal women and strongly influences insulin sensitivity in the early postmenopausal period .Exercise has been shown to affect abdominal, or visceral, body fat preferentially . Several studies have shown that decreased fasting plasma insulin, increases in insulin sensitivity, or a decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through physical exercise is mediated through improvements in adiposity , especially central adiposity . Previously sedentary overweight or obese postmenopausal women were randomized to a 12-month moderate-intensity exercise intervention or a stretching control group. Exercise effects on changes in insulin concentrations were modified by changes in total fat mass . This was primarily because of the exercise effect among women who gained total fat mass; in this group, exercisers had a smaller increase in fasting insulin concentrations than controls . However, among exercisers, those who lost >2 kg of fat mass had a significantly larger decline in plasma insulin over the year than those who had gained fat mass. Interestingly, in this study exercise effects on changes in insulin concentrations were not modified by changes in intra-abdominal fat.Wong et al. reported that, for a given BMI, men in the high fitness group had significantly lower waist circumference , total abdominal fat , visceral fat , and abdominal subcutaneous fat compared with men in the low fitness group. Other investigators have shown that an increase in physical activity without dietary intervention produced significant decreases in intra-abdominal fat mass and that improvements in cardiovascular risk factors were related to the loss of centralized body fat rather than to improved fitness . Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of exercise and the degree of exerciseinduced weight, fat, and intra-abdominal fat mass loss has been shown in a dose-dependent manner .FIGURE 8.1 Percent difference in insulin by changes in total fat mass comparing those who gained total body fat vs. those who lost total body fat . Statistical significance of the overall trend in interventioncontrol group differences across groups of fat mass change from baseline to 12 months: p-trend = 0.03.\n",

      "Table 8.1 presents several randomized controlled trials that include aerobic or endurance exercise interventions vs. control group on the effects of glucose homeostasis in diabetic and nondiabetic participants. Criteria used for this review included evidence-based medicine or best practice in utilizing exercise to attenuate several conditions of glucose intolerance. The table includes the basic study design, the number of subjects completing the trial compared to the number of subjects randomized to each group , length of training period, and key outcomes. Studies were included if they were of at least 3 months duration, had a sample size of at least 20 subjects, and enabled the assessment of the role of the intervention on insulin action . Although improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness measures are not discussed in detail, it must be noted that exercise promoted improvements in VO2 max independently of losses in body weight .Several controlled studies have shown an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in abdominal adiposity with aerobic exercise . Several of these investigators observed, through subgroup analysis, that the exercise effect on insulin sensitivity or obesity biomarkers such as insulin may be modified by age, loss of body fat, or other potential biological mechanisms. Short et al. evaluated the effects of 16 weeks of aerobic exercise vs. control in men and women on insulin sensitivity and muscle mitochondria. The exercise program was performed on a stationary bike, initiated with three sessions per week, 20-min duration, and gradually increased to four sessions per week at 80% of maximal heart rate for 40 min. Exercise increased muscle GLUT4 mRNA and protein by 30 to 52% and reduced abdominal fat by 5% and plasma triglycerides by 25%. Insulin sensitivity improved in younger vs. older participants, suggesting that the insulin sensitivity response to exercise may be modified by age.Pratley et al. tested effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training on glucosestimulated insulin responses in middle-aged and older individuals over a 9-month period. Subjects were stabilized on the step I American Heart Association diet before training, and calories were increased to prevent weight loss. The aerobic exercise training program included stationary bicycling, walking, and jogging three times per week at an exercise facility with the goal for intensity and duration of 75 to 85% heart rate reserve for 30 to 45 min, respectively. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and glucose responses during the oral glucose tolerance test did not change, but insulin response during the oral glucose tolerance test decreased by 16% after training. Training reduced early and late phase insulin responses by 14% , but did not significantly change glucose disposal . The authors concluded that the decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with aerobic exercise training in middle-aged and older men appears to be mediated, at least in part, by reductions in the amount of abdominal fat.Potteiger et al. examined the insulin and glucose response during an oral glucose tolerance test in overweight young adults prior to and following exercise training in the Midwest Exercise Trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to nonexercise control or exercise groups. The exercise intervention comprised supervised exercise , 3 to 5 days per week in 20- to 45-min sessions at 60 to 75% of heart rate reserve for 16 months. For glucose area under the curve , no significant differences were found between exercisers or controls across the 16 months of the study. Insulin area under the curve in male exercisers decreased significantly from baseline to 9 months. The authors concluded that regular exercise in healthy, previously sedentary, overweight adult males leads to improvements in VO, max, weight loss and a reduction in the insulin concentration required to dispose of a setther outcomes, body over + wt. nd in pations = U writing = U WL greater than all other groups ge ↓ in total abdomin n the EX-induced WImen Overweight men mean age 46 years Healthy obese 43–56 years) Obese mer erage improvement in Glu disposal will be milar milar in the diet-induced and EX- Iduced WL groups , and be induced WL group showed greats provement did not of the more in the more Provenent did more of member of the many of the mail.

In females, improvement in VO, max without weight loss did not lead to improvement in insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that gender may modify the changes in insulin sensitivity from the exercise-induced changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and weight loss, at least for young adults.Watkins et al. evaluated the effects of a 6-month intervention involving aerobic exercise training alone or exercise combined with a structured weight loss program on coronary heart disease risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Participants exercised three to four times per week for 26 weeks at a level of 70 to 85% of their initial HRR by walking, jogging, or cycling at a supervised facility. Hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose challenge were significantly reduced in the exercise plus weight loss group and the exercise-only group. Participants with the greatest amount of weight loss showed the most robust improvements in abnormal insulin responses. The authors concluded that the addition of a structured weight loss program to an exercise intervention produces a larger degree of improvement in insulin response compared to exercise alone. However, they stressed that although these results reaffirmed the importance of weight loss in improving hyperinsulinemia, weight loss in this study was achieved in the context of an exercise intervention.Dengel et al. studied the independent and combined effects of aerobic exercise training and weight loss on glucose metabolism in 47 nondiabetic sedentary older men. There were 14 men in a weekly behavioral modification/weight loss program, 10 in a three times per week aerobic exercise program, 14 in an aerobic exercise plus weight loss program, and 9 in the control group. Exercise training consisted of stationary cycling and walking or jogging on a treadmill at an exercise facility with intensity and duration goals of 75 to 85% heart rate reserve for 40 min, respectively. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed significant reductions in insulin responses in all intervention groups, with the decrease in insulin response in the aerobic exercise plus weight loss group significantly greater than that in the other three groups. The glucose area under the curve decreased significantly in the weight loss and in the aerobic exercise plus weight loss groups, but did not change in the control or in the aerobic exercise-alone groups. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal rates, as measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps, increased significantly in the aerobic exercise and aerobic exercise plus weight loss groups; they were significantly greater than those in the weight loss and control groups. These data suggest that aerobic exercise and weight loss improve glucose metabolism through different mechanisms and that the combined intervention of aerobic exercise plus weight loss may be necessary to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in older men.Despite evidence that exercise appears to improve insulin action independently of changes in body composition, research is ongoing in order to compare the efficacy of diet-induced vs. exerciseinduced improvements in body composition, insulin sensitivity, and other chronic disease risk factors. For more studies examining the diet-induced decreases in weight and adiposity, the reader is encouraged to see the Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, the Evidence Report, from the National Heart Blood and Lung Institute .Ross et al. determined the effects of equivalent diet- or exercise-induced weight loss and exercise without weight loss on subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and insulin sensitivity in obese women. Premenopausal women with abdominal obesity were randomly assigned to one of four groups: diet weight loss , exercise weight loss , exercise without weight loss , and a weight-stable control group . Subjects in both exercise groups performed daily exercise at approximately 80% of their maximal heart rate and in order to expend 500 kcal for the duration of the 14-week trial.Body weight decreased by approximately 6.5% within both weight loss groups and was unchanged in the exercise without weight loss and control groups. Reduction in total, abdominal, and abdominal subcutaneous fat within the exercise weight loss group was greater thanwithin all other groups. The reduction in total and abdominal fat within the diet weight loss and exercise without weight loss groups was greater than within controls but not different from each other . Visceral fat decreased within all treatment groups, and these changes were not different from each other. In comparison with the control group, insulin sensitivity improved within the exercise weight loss group alone and, in comparison with controls, cardiorespiratory fitness improved within the exercise groups only . This study underscores the importance of exercise, even without weight loss, to reduce substantially total fat, abdominal fat, visceral fat, and to improve insulin resistance in obese women.Ross et al. determined the effects of equivalent diet- or exercise-induced weight loss and exercise without weight loss on subcutaneous fat, visceral fat skeletal muscle mass, and insulin sensitivity in 52 obese men with a mean waist circumference of 110.1 ± 5.8 cm. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four study groups and were observed for 3 months. The intervention included daily exercise at an intensity of <70% of their initial VO, max or approximately 80% of maximal heart rate for the time it took to expend 700 kcal. Similar reductions in abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, and visceral fat to subcutaneous fat ratios were observed in the weight loss groups. Plasma glucose and insulin values did not change in the treatment groups compared with controls. However, the average improvement in glucose disposal was similar in both weight loss groups. Of note is that weight loss induced by increased daily physical activity without caloric restriction substantially reduced obesity and insulin resistance in men.Katzel et al. compared the effects of weight loss from a hypocaloric diet vs. aerobic exercise training on coronary artery disease risk factors in healthy, sedentary, obese middle-aged and older men. Diet-induced weight loss decreased fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and glucose and insulin areas during the oral glucose tolerance test . By contrast, aerobic exercise did not improve fasting glucose or insulin concentrations or glucose responses during the oral glucose tolerance test, but it decreased insulin areas. In an analysis of variance, the decrement in fasting glucose and insulin levels and glucose areas with intervention differed between weight loss and aerobic exercise when compared with the control group . In multiple regression analyses, the improvement in glucose metabolism was related primarily to the reduction in obesity. These authors concluded that weight loss - not aerobic fitness - is the preferred treatment to improve coronary artery disease risk factors in overweight middle-aged and older men.Hellenius et al. studied 157 normoglycemic healthy men with moderately elevated cardiovascular risk factors and randomly assigned them to one of four groups: diet advice , exercise advice , a combination of both , and a control group . Participants in the exercise group were asked to engage in regular aerobic exercise two to three times per week at an intensity of 60 to 80% of maximal heart rate for a duration of 30 to 45 min. Results showed that the number of pathological oral glucose tolerance tests in the intervention groups decreased from 42/118 to 33/118 compared to no change in the control group. Fasting insulin levels decreased in the exercise and the combined diet + exercise groups as well as insulin areas under the oral glucose tolerance test curve. Significant increases in IGFBP-1 were observed for all three intervention groups, especially the combined diet + exercise group . The marked changes in IGFBP-1 suggested a decrease in insulin secretion and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The researchers concluded that a combination of increased exercise and improved diet, as well as increased exercise alone, improved glucose and insulin homeostasis in middle-aged men with moderately elevated cardiovascular risk factors.Serum insulin levels have been used as an estimate of insulin sensitivity and a significant independent relationship between hyperinsulinemia and chronic disease risk has been reported from several large epidemiological studies . Exercise has been shown to lower insulin concentrations with and without weight loss . Furthermore, intermittent exercise for 18 months (walking briskly at approximately 50 to 65% heart rate reserve, two times per day, 15 minper session, 5 days per week) or continuous exercise for 12 months has been shown to improve serum or plasma insulin concentrations in obese females. However, interestingly, Donnelly et al. showed that intermittent exercise did not affect body weight, percent body fat, and fat mass from baseline to 18 months; however, continuous exercise resulted in significant differences in body weight, total body fat, intra-abdominal fat, and subcutaneous body fat from baseline to 12 months . They suggested that insulin concentrations are affected by intermittent and continuous exercise with or without concomitant weight loss or changes in body composition. Furthermore, short-term exercise training in overweight males has been shown to improve insulin resistance by using the homeostasis model assessment score, a surrogate measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity .Previously sedentary overweight or obese postmenopausal women randomized to a 12-month study examining the effects of moderate-intensity exercise vs. stretching control showed short-term and long-term improvements in HOMA scores . Compared with baseline, exercisers had a 7 and 2% decline in HOMA scores, whereas controls had a 10 and 14% increase in HOMA scores, at 3 and 12 months , respectively . Glycemic control through improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin has also been shown to improve after 12 weeks of walking 1 h per day, 5 days per week in diabetic postmenopausal as well as in normoglycemic postmenopausal women . In conclusion, there appears to be sufficient evidence that aerobic exercise can improve insulin sensitivity as measured by more sophisticated methods or by using less sensitive measures and/or blood biomarkers .\n",

      "Several limitations are present when reviewing the literature regarding the effects of resistance training on insulin resistance, including small sample sizes, inconsistent protocols, and lack of longer term studies. For randomized clinical studies that have been published within the last 10 years, four studies used a nonexercising control group , two compared aerobic training vs. resistance training , and four observed the effects of aerobic-plusresistance training on insulin sensitivity . Few studies included normal vs. impaired glucose-tolerant or diabetic participants . Other studies had no control group,FIGURE 8.2 Percent difference in HOMA scores at 3 and 12 months. HOMA was used as a surrogate measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity and was calculated as fasting glucose × fasting insulin /22.5). Significant differences in percent change in HOMA scores at 3 and 12 months postrandomization of overweight/obese previously sedentary postmenopausal women.per se; however, they observed pre-post training differences or randomized participants to resistance training vs. resistance training plus diet-induced weight loss groups .Although most studies were at least 6 weeks in duration, three studies examined insulin sensitivity after a single bout of resistance exercise . Chapman et al. examined healthy, postmenopausal women before and after a session of three sets of ten repetitions performed at 50, 75, and 100% of a ten-repetition-maximum for seven different exercises. They found that insulin sensitivity was unaltered by a single session of resistance exercise in postmenopausal women. In contrast, Fluckey et al. showed that a single bout of resistance training using several Nautilus exercise machines) improved insulin area under the curves in male and female young and type-2 diabetic subjects, but not in older, nondiabetic subjects . In agreement with these findings, Fenicchia et al. reported that the glucose area under the curve improved significantly after an acute bout of resistance training , but was not improved with chronic resistance training in type-2 diabetic women or age-matched controls. Therefore, several biological mechanisms may modify the effects of insulin sensitivity to a single resistance-training bout, including age or glucose intolerance. More research is needed in order to explain these differences.Consistent among these studies, however, was the significant increase in strength that accompanied long-term resistance exercise training . Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that improvement in insulin sensitivity was highly correlated with increased muscle mass . Therefore, it is not surprising that resistance training resulted in improvements in insulin action in several , but not all , of the previously listed trials.Comparison of the effects of endurance vs. resistance training on glucose tolerance has been studied . Eriksson et al. randomized 14 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance into an aerobic-trained group vs. a nonexercising control group and compared the effects on body composition and insulin sensitivity in eight male subjects randomized to a progressive circuit-type resistance program . No significant differences were found between the aerobic-exercise intervention and the control group for any of the parameters assessed. However, a significant 23% improvement in total body glucose disposal was observed in the circuittrained group. The authors attributed this improvement in glucose disposal to a 27% increase in nonoxidative glucose disposal.In contrast, Smutok et al. studied 26 untrained men with type-2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance randomly assigned to a strength-training group , aerobic training group , or no exercise control group for 20 weeks and found that both intervention groups improved plasma glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test compared to controls. No significant differences in insulin sensitivity between the two intervention groups were found. A 12% reduction in total glucose area under the curve was found in the strength-training group compared to a 16% reduction in the aerobic-trained group. Fasting insulin levels were reduced in the strength-training group but not in the aerobic-trained group. Total insulin area under the curve was decreased by 22% following the strength-training program and 21% following the aerobic-trained program. Glucose tolerance was normalized for impaired glucose tolerant subjects following either intervention program; however, subjects with type-2 diabetes did not obtain oral glucose tolerance tests, which fell out of the diagnostic range for diabetes, despite improvements in glucose tolerance.The effects of endurance and resistance training on insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia have also been studied. Cuff et al. studied 28 obese postmenopausal women with type-2 diabetes randomly assigned to one of three 16-week treatments: control, aerobic only training, or aerobic plus resistance training. Glucose infusion rates increased significantly in theaerobic-plus-resistance training group. In addition, the aerobic-plus-resistance training group exhibited a significantly greater increase in muscle density than the aerobic-only training group. Improved glucose disposal was independently associated with changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and muscle density. Furthermore, muscle density retained a relationship with glucose disposal after controlling for abdominal adipose tissue.Wallace et al. studied sedentary adult males with hyperinsulinemia randomly assigned to an endurance-only group or a cross-training group in a single session). The changes induced by cross-training were significantly greater than those from endurance training alone in percent fat , insulin concentration , and glucose levels .Ferrara et al. examined the effects of 4 months of resistance exercise to an existing aerobic exercise program compared to a \"maintenance\" aerobic exercise program in overweight, older men. The subjects in this study had recently completed a 6-month aerobic exercise program . The aerobic-plus-resistance trained group added six exercises on upper- and lower-body pneumatic-resistance machines to an aerobic-only exercise program at ≥70% heart rate reserve for 30 to 40 min, 2 days/week on a treadmill. The aerobic-trained group continued the same maintenance treadmill program. No baseline differences in body weight, VO2 max, or glucose metabolism were found between groups. The aerobic-plus-resistance trained group increased upper- and lowerextremity strength , despite a 9% decrease in VO2 max ; VO2 max did not change in the aerobic-only trained group. The insulin responses decreased by 25 ± 4% in the aerobic-plus-resistance trained group , but did not change in the aerobic trained only group. However, no changes occurred in fasting glucose or insulin levels or the 3-h glucose responses to an oral glucose load in either group.These results suggest an additive benefit of resistance training and aerobic training compared to aerobic training alone to improve insulin sensitivity, especially when such training results in loss of abdominal, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue as well as increased muscle density. Poehlman et al. showed that endurance and resistance training improved insulin sensitivity but that, when the glucose disposal rate was expressed per kilogram of fat-free mass, the improved insulin sensitivity persisted in endurance-trained women only. These results suggest that the combined endurance- and resistance-training effect on insulin sensitivity may be modified by gender; however, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.Resistance training has also been shown to improve markers of glycemic control - namely, glycosylated hemoglobin - as well as body composition . In addition, 10 weeks of resistance training resulted in significantly lower total body fat compared to aerobic training in untrained males. Furthermore, the effect of a 25-week resistance training program on intra-abdominal adipose tissue in older women and men showed that despite similar decreases in fat mass, women lost significant amounts of intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat compared to men . These results suggest that the resistance-training changes in adiposity may be modified by gender.\n",

      "Although not exhaustive, several studies have examined the effects of diet plus aerobic exercise or resistance exercise on glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. However, the primary aim of these trials was to induce weight loss and, secondarily, to observe the effects on insulin resistance. Goodpaster et al. showed improvements in insulin sensitivity after combined exercise- and diet-induced weight loss in obese subjects and that the weight loss was likely due to increased fat oxidation during fasting conditions. Exercise training at moderate intensity can induce a higher capacity for, and reliance upon, fat oxidation during the exercise session , and chronic effects of exercise, such as increased activity of oxidative enzymes and increased capillary density, facilitate fatty acid utilization at rest and during physical activity . Thus, it is likely that the enhanced fat oxidation during fasting is due to exercise and not caloric restriction. In addition, unlike diet-induced negative energy balance, in which muscle plays a passive role, exercise-induced negative energy balance has been shown to be associated with concomitant muscle consumption of glycogen and triglyceride .Several large randomized controlled trials have examined a lifestyle intervention on improving insulin resistance. Most of these studies have shown that insulin resistance was improved in the intervention group, but not independently from changes in weight or body composition. In addition, clinical evidence from multicenter trials has suggested that a lifestyle intervention of diet and increased physical activity can decrease the incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus . Therefore, physical activity should be an adjuvant to diet-induced weight loss strategies and clinicians should stress the importance of exercise in the lifestyle management of chronic disease.\n",

      "Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes mellitus, and several cancers. Cancer research has shown that high levels of plasma insulin as well as insulin-like growth factors can stimulate cell growth and inhibit apoptosis . Physical exercise has been shown to be an important adiunct to the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance because exercise training has been associated with increases in skeletal muscle insulin action and reduction in adipose tissue. Through multifaceted molecular and intracellular systems, exercise can attenuate and abolish increases in insulin concentrations, even in individuals who gain body fat. Complete elucidation of the exercise-induced molecular and intracellular signaling pathways responsible for the amelioration of several chronic diseases will be a worthwhile goal for the improvement of public health. Additional exercise intervention trials in cancer prevention research, with protocol methodologies including validated measures of insulin sensitivity, are recommended to better understand the associations between exercise and insulin resistance.\n",

      "There is mounting evidence that the benefits of physical activity go above and beyond those of weight loss and cardiovascular fitness. Numerous cross-sectional studies and a growing body of exercise intervention studies suggest that habitual physical activity may enhance immune function. In addition to the observed decreased incidence of respiratory infections among moderate-intensity exercisers,1-6 exercise may induce augmentation of immune function through enhanced natural killer cell cytotoxicity, increases in CD4 and CD8 cell counts, and increases in concentrations of circulating antibodies . Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of regular exercise may also protect against other infections, may contribute to enhanced wound healing, and may contribute to the observed decreased incidence of certain types of cancers among physically active individuals.7-10Regular physical activity may also be associated with improved cancer prognosis, at least in the early stages of the disease, and reduced mortality rates for certain types of cancers.13 Although the data are still relatively sparse and inconsistent, the potential immunomodulatory impact of moderate intensity physical activity may have profound public health implications. This review will summarize the findings of a growing body of literature exploring the effects of moderate-intensity exercise on the immune system.\n",

      "Comprising a complex network of organs, tissues, cells, and soluble factors, the immune system guards the body from bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. The immune system is also capable of recognizing and eliminating cells that have become cancerous.11 Many of the components of this multifaceted system have specialized functions; some are designed to elicit a nonspecific response, and others produce a specific response.Major components of the nonspecific immune response include phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which attract, adhere to, engulf, and ingest extracellular pathogens such as bacteria. In addition to nonspecific phagocytosis, macrophages also secrete enzymes, coagulation factors, and several cytokines , such as interleukin-6 , interleukin-1 , and tumor necrosis factor-α . These secreted cytokines induce hepatic transcription factors to upregulate expression of nonspecific acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A , which are markers of inflammatory processes.11-14 Natural killer cells another major component of the nonspecific immune response, lyse cells that have become abnormal or virus infected. The complement system, a complex-triggered enzyme plasma system that coats microbes with molecules and makes them more susceptible to engulfment by phagocytes, is yet another component of the nonspecific immune response; it is the major effector of the humoral immune response.11The major components of the specific immune response, T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. T-lymphocytes, which form the basis of acquired immune recognition , mature in the thymus and secrete cytokines, such as interleukins and interferons, which regulate the complex interactions among lymphocytes and other components of the immune system. These soluble signaling proteins have the potential to influence a variety of downstream parameters of immune function. T-lymphocytes are also capable of attacking other cells directly, through the action of lymphotoxins, which are secreted by cytotoxic T-cells and can induce lysis of infected or abnormal cells. Additionally, lymphokines secreted by helper/inducer T-cells stimulate proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, induce Bcells to produce antibodies, attract neutrophils, and enhance the ability of macrophages to engulf and destroy microbes. B-lymphocvtes primarily function as mediators of humoral immunity via secretion of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins . Antibodies, each of which has a unique molecular structure corresponding to a specific antigen, bind to and neutralize pathogens so that they may be destroyed by phagocytes. Long-lived memory B-cells are programmed to recognize and respond quickly and efficiently to subsequent invasions by pathogens that have previously been targeted.11With its complex yet efficient network of interacting components, the immune system has the ability to protect the body from foreign organisms and from cancer development. Research has shown that aging or lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress can inhibit optimal immune response, impeding the immune system from fulfilling its mission.\n",

      "As mentioned earlier, in addition to protecting against bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections, the immune system is also thought to play a role in protecting against carcinogenesis by recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells.11,15 Additionally, immunodeficiency of any origin, whether it is congenital, therapeutic , or acquired via infection, has been observed to increase the risk of certain types of cancer, specifically those etiologically associated with viral infections.15.16 AIDS patients, who have T-cell deficiencies, not only have an increased risk of AIDS-defining malignancies , but also show in cohort studies an increased risk of several types of solid tumors, including lung and, probably, colon cancer. 17,18Data from a large, population-based cohort study in Japan suggest that differences in immunological host defense - specifically, natural killer cell cytotoxic activity - among apparently healthy individuals may influence stomach, lung, and intestine cancer risk.19 This study followed approximately 3500 adults for 11 years, recorded more than 150 incident cancer cases during follow-up, and found that men in the lowest tertile for natural killer cell activity were at an estimated 40 to 60% increased risk of developing cancer compared to those with medium or high NK cell activity ; women in the lowest tertile were at approximately 70 to 90% increased risk .19Studies have detected elevated levels of CRP in patients with advanced breast cancer and suggest that CRP concentrations increase as the disease progresses to more advanced stages.20-22 Although it is likely that these elevated concentrations merely signal the presence of an inflammatory response to the breast tumor, recent findings by Erlinger and colleagues support the notion of inflammation as an actual risk factor for colorectal cancer.23 Data from their prospective, nested case-control study of a cohort of almost 23,000 adults followed for approximately 11 years indicate that baseline plasma CRP concentrations were significantly higher among those who subsequently developed colorectal cancer compared to controls . These findings suggest that even modestly elevated levels of CRP are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, convincing evidence indicates that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , including aspirin, is associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer and colorectal adenomas, other cancers of the digestive tract, and, possibly, breast or lung cancer.24-34\n",

      "Several in vivo and in vitro techniques have been developed to measure immune function. Many assays have been designed to enumerate specific classes of immune cells or simply to measure the presence of signaling molecules or antibodies; however, several assays have been designed to measure specific cellular functions . Determining the clinical significance of \"altered immunity\" as measured by any of the available in vivo or in vitro assays is a challenge.35 Many of the advantages and limitations of the wide variety of immune function assays employed in the literature have been reviewed by Vedhara et al.35 and Mitchell et al.36 and deserve some consideration here.Enumeration and phenotyping of immune cells by flow cytometry is a commonly employed assay for the measurement of immune function. This technique involves the identification of cell types using color-labeled antibodies that recognize cell type-specific markers. This method has high reproducibility and allows for the comparison of cell ratios and the analysis of cell counts. Enumerative assays may be limited by a lack of correspondence between cell number and cell activity37; however, in combination with functional assays, it is possible to ascertain whether observed alterations in enumerative assays are of functional relevance.Another method for assaying immune function involves measuring the concentration of circulating cytokines, or cytokines secreted in vitro. As mentioned earlier, cytokines are signaling molecules that regulate the complex interactions among lymphocytes and other components of the immune system; therefore, the concentration of these signaling molecules may mediate the up- or down-regulation of the immune response. Assays have been designed to measure concentrations of a variety of major cytokines, including IL-1, which affects T-cell activation, and IL-2, which is produced by T-helper cells and induces T-cell proliferation. Unfortunately, assessment of serum cytokine levels, although useful for determining the presence or degree of inflammation, does not necessarily provide a good measure of normal function of the immune response due to the usually low concentrations of circulating cytokines detected in the plasma of healthy individuals. Thus, polyclonal mitogen stimulation is a commonly employed technique for measuring cytokine levels produced by proliferating lymphocytes in vitro.Antibody assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are a simple, robust, and sensitive means of measuring the efficacy of humoral immune response by quantifying the amount of antibody secreted by B-cells following exposure to antigens. However, total antibody levels are a poor indicator of specific antibody response. Therefore, antigen-specific antibody assays, which may have greater clinical relevance, are preferred over measurement of total antibody levels, which may obscure true relationships between physical activity and a specific antibody response.Assays that target cell function such as proliferation or cytotoxicity, may provide a more meaningful assessment of immune function. Lymphocyte proliferation occurs naturally in the presence of pathogens and serves to increase the number of immune cells available to fight an infection. The effectiveness of T-lymphocyte proliferation can be measured in vitro by culturing Tcells in the presence of common mitogens or specific antigens, although this method does not always accurately reflect the in vivo response of the cells.Cytotoxicity assays assess the cytotoxic potential of cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells critical in the defense against infections and tumors. These assays measure the ability to lyse target tumor cells in vitro.26,38 However, these techniques cannot identify the mechanism associated with observed reduced cytotoxicity. For example, cytotoxicity may be impaired due to a variety of defects in the immune response, including: antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, defects in the release or function of perforin , or decreased proliferation of effector cells. Additionally, in most cases, it is not possible to attribute the cytotoxic effects exclusively to natural killer cells or other lymphocyte subsets. Although the mechanisms underlying potential deficiencies cannot be readily delineated, the interplay of multiple cell types does more accurately reflect in vivo immune function. 35,36,39Because each of these techniques for measuring immune function has advantages and limitations, 35,36 most studies rely on a combination of assays to assess immune function.\n",

      "*Subjects are cancer patients who received high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplants. 'Subjects are moderate trainers; among subset of light trainers a transient exercise-induced increase was followed by significant decrease.9Decrease seen only in subset of exercisers with moderate to severe chronic heart failure ; no decrease in healthy subjects .77 years), randomized to 20 to 50 minutes of brisk walking three times per week at 70% of their heart rate reserve for 10 weeks, compared to 14 nonexercise controls with whom they lived.50In addition. NK cell cytotoxicity was also assessed for a subset of the elderly participants in a 6-month randomized-controlled trial conducted by Woods and colleagues and was found to be nonsignificantly higher among those randomized to the exercise intervention compared to stretchers in the control group.51 It is possible that the size of the subset selected for this assay was simply too small to detect any statistically significant intervention effects. Another small randomized study among 50 mildly obese women , of whom only 36 completed the 3month trial, detected significantly increased NK cell cytotoxicity 6 weeks into the intervention, but not at week 15.1Although the data are not conclusive, most evidence from randomized-controlled trials to date suggests that exercise has no statistically significant effect on NK cell cytotoxicity. However, the assigned exercise interventions may have been too shortin duration to show effects. Certainly, the implications for enhanced NK cell function associated with habitual moderate intensity physical activity would be profound, especially in light of findings from epidemiological studies, which noted increased cancer incidence with depressed natural killer cell cytotoxicity .19Similarly, most evidence from randomized-controlled trials suggests that moderateintensity exercise has no statistically significant effect on lymphocyte proliferation.3.44.50-56 Details of two of these studies with null findings, conducted by Nieman et al. and Fahlman et al., have been described earlier in this chapter.3,50 Mitchell et al. assessed lymphocyte proliferation in 21 male college students who completed a 12-week randomized exercise intervention, consisting of 30 minutes on a stationary bike three times per week, at 75% of their VO, peak.33 It is possible that this study was unable to detect any significant exercise effects because young people generally have better immune function regardless of exercise tendencies.Woods et al. randomized 33 otherwise healthy elderly individuals to 15 to 40 minutes of supervised brisk walking or stretching three times per week.31 For the 29 subjects who completed the 6-month intervention, no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte proliferation was observed, despite a significant increase in VO, max among the exercisers. In fact, both groups exhibited increased lymphocyte proliferation, which was somewhat, though nonsignificantly, greater among the exercisers. A large randomized-controlled study among mildly obese women also found no statistically significant effect of exercise on lymphocyte proliferation22; however, this study did suffer from a 28% dropout rate, which could have biased the results. A small 8-week randomized-controlled trial among middle-aged individuals with rheumatoid arthritis also reported no statistically significant effect.44Finally, in the large four-arm exercise and diet study conducted by Nieman et al. , a significant decrease in lymphocyte proliferation was detected among those randomized to exercise only.4 This study also assessed monocyte and granulocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst and did not detect any significant effect associated with the exercise intervention.\n",

For example, some studies report reduced total leukocyte counts among exercisers73,74,76,78 whereas several others did not.3,96,99As was the case with NK cell cytotoxicity, the majority of the well-conducted intervention studies assessing NK cell count were unable to detect any significant effect associated with physical activity 1.3.43-45,51,57 . However, two nonrandomized studies have reported increased54,55 NK cell counts associated with exercise interventions and although Fahlman et al. detected increased NK cell cytotoxicity among 15 elderly nuns randomized to the exercise intervention, they found decreased NK cell counts among these exercisers concurrent with increased NK cell counts among nonexercising controls.50All of the exercise intervention studies published in the last two decades indicate that exercise has no statistically significant effect on total leukocyte counts. 3.43-45,51,52,58 With the exception of one randomized-controlled study that suffered from 28% dropout rate,52 the literature to date also suggests no statistically significant effect of exercise on total lymphocyte counts. 3.43-45,51,58Although the data are less consistent with respect to CD4 and CD8 counts, the majority of the studies that have investigated the effects of exercise on either of these measures of immune function were unable to detect any significant effect.3.44,51,52 However, two randomized-controlled trials did report significant increases in CD4 and CD8 counts among subjects randomized to exercise, but no effect on CD4 counts among exercisers43,59 and one randomized-controlled trial detected a significant decrease in CD8 counts.50Though the majority of the studies that have investigated the impact of exercise on the CD4:CD8 ratio found no significant effect, 44,52,54,56,60 the largest randomized study to present data on this measure of immune function reports a significant decrease among male coronary artery disease patients being treated with atenolol; they were randomized to aerobic walking or running for 45 minutes, three to four times per week, at 65 to 70% of the maximal work capacity of each subject.43\n",

      "Concentrations of markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A , are often elevated among overweight or obese individuals — an association most likely related to the upstream role of adipose tissue-secreted cytokines in the production of these acute phase proteins. In fact, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A have been associated with body fatness01-70 and sedentary lifestyles61,69,71-81 in cross-sectional survevs. Despite a strong suggestion of an association between lower concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A. IL-6, and TNF-α with increasing level of physical activity observed in these cross-sectional studies , the best designed intervention studies actually support the absence of a significant association between exercise and these markers of inflammation .For example, three large, well-designed randomized-controlled trials have yielded results indicating that physical activity interventions have no significant effect on serum concentrations of CRP.58,88,89 Specifically, de Jong and colleagues were unable to detect a significant association between C-reactive protein levels and exercise intervention among 217 frail elderly individuals randomized to an exercise intervention , micronutrient-supplemented diet, exercise and diet, or control group.58 Although only 145 subjects completed the 17-week intervention, the authors indicate that the high dropout rate was mainly due to health problems and not related to the assigned intervention.In a more recent four-armed randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of exercise, diet-induced weight loss, or the combination of exercise and diet-induced weight loss on markers of inflammation. Nicklas and colleagues also found that exercise had no significant effect on circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein among the 252 older , obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis who completed the 18-month trial.88 Although this study had only 80% retention, the authors report that concentrations of inflammatory markers from the baseline blood draws were not statistically significantly different for subjects who completed, dropped out, or failed to provide follow-up blood samples. They suggested that individuals for whom change in concentration of inflammatory markers could not be assessed were similar to those who completed the 18 months, with respect to baseline inflammatory markers.Additionally, Rauramaa et al. conducted an impressive 6-year randomized-controlled study, in which 140 middle-aged men were randomized to exercise for 30 to 60 minutes, three to five times per week.99 The C-reactive protein concentrations of the 125 men who completed the study were analyzed on an intent-totreat basis. At the end of the 6-year intervention, circulating C-reactive protein levels were lower among those randomized to exercise; however, despite the large sample size, the difference was not statistically significant . Finally, a small 8-week randomized trial similarly found no significant effect on C-reactive protein among rheumatoid arthritis patients randomized to bicycle training four to five times per week at 80% of the subjects' VO2 max.44Of the four intervention studies that reported a decrease in C-reactive protein levels associated with physical activity, three were nonrandomized®-92 . The one randomized study to date that has reported a decrease in C-reactive protein associated with an intervention was primarily focused on weight loss through a low-energy Mediterranean-style diet among 120 obese premenopausal women.93 Participants randomized to the intervention arm also received information about the importance of physical activity, mainly through walking, and attended monthly or bimonthly sessions with an exercise trainer. No structured exercise regimen was established for participants randomized to the intervention arm in this study, and evidence of change in physical activity level in study subjects was assessed only through selfreport. Nonetheless, women randomized to the intervention group reportedly increased from 64 to 175 minutes of physical activity per week, compared to women in the control group who increased from 71 to only 102 minutes per week . At the end of the 24-month trial, women randomized to the intervention had experienced significant reductions in BMI and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, although the effect of the modest exercise aspect of the intervention of this randomized-controlled trial could not be isolated from that of the effects of the diet-induced weight loss.Likewise, the majority of findings from studies investigating the effects of exercise on levels of IL-6, a precursor in the production of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, are similarly most convincing for no effect,44,83-89,90 with a handful of studies reporting a significant decrease. 84,86,93 Interestingly, Adamopoulos et al. observed a significant decrease in IL-6 among exercisers with chronic heart failure, but not among healthy exercisers.84 Gielen et al. observed a significant decrease in IL-6 expression in local skeletal muscle but no effect on serum concentrations of the proinflammatory molecule. 66 Finally, while some studies have also shown that consistent exercise significantly lowers levels of other cytokines implicated in the production of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α, 82-84,86,166 others have not. 44,84-88\n",

      "As reviewed in Chapter 5, despite the imperfect measurement of physical activity, results of epidemiological studies indicate that a higher activity level is associated with a 50% reduction in risk of colon cancer . These results are consistent across various populations, study designs , and types of activities . Perhaps the only debatable issue is whether strenuous and nonstrenuous activities are equally protective. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms of action responsible for the association between higher physical activity and lower risk of colon cancer.Proposed biological mechanisms for the effect of physical activity on colon carcinogenesis include a decrease in bowel transit time, alteration of immune function, decreased bile acid metabolism, and insulin resistance . Alternatively, given the evidence linking higher prostaglandin production to the development of colorectal cancer, it is plausible that physical activity may protect against colon cancer through its effect on mucosal prostaglandin levels.\n",

      "Prostaglandins are the primary cellular metabolites from the action of the cyclooxygenases on arachidonic acid and exert various physiological actions in the gastrointestinal tract, including maintenance of mucosal integrity, regulation of secretion, and motility . Previous research has suggested that prostaglandins play a role in the development of colon cancer given that tumor cells produce higher amounts of prostaglandins than normal cells. Increased prostaglandin production, particularly of the E series, has been reported in colonic tumor cells in humans and in experimental models . It has also been shown that individuals with colorectal polyps or cancer have higher levels of colonic mucosal prostaglandin E2 than control individuals do .The mechanism by which prostaglandins contribute to colon carcinogenesis remains uncertain. Prostaglandins may modulate the development of colorectal neoplasia through the stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation or the inhibition of apoptosis . Furthermore, prostaglandins are known to regulate growth and spread of tumors . It is also possible that the effect of prostaglandins is mediated by nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors , which have been shown to alter colon carcinogenesis . Because PGI, has been found to act as a ligand for PPARδ , and PPARy is activated by fatty acids and other arachidonic acid metabolites, it is possible that prostaglandins alter colon carcinogenesis through this receptor.Support for the role of prostaglandins on colorectal neoplasia is derived from animal and human studies in which aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis - reduce risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas . The biological mechanism is thought to be through the effect of these agents on arachidonic acid metabolism by inhibiting cycooxygenases, key enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid . At least two isoforms of cycooxygenase exist in humans. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues. Conversely, COX-2 is induced by agents such as cytokines and growth factors. However, whether COX-2 directly modulates the function of tumor cells is still unclear, so it is possible that prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are responsible for tumor promotion.\n",

      "Given the consistent epidemiological findings for the protective effect of physical activity on colon cancer, as well as the strong link between prostaglandin synthesis and colorectal neoplasia, an observational cross-sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that physical activity mediates colon cancer risk through its effect on PGE, synthesis . Analyses were conducted among 41 men and 22 women, 42 to 78 years of age and with a history of polyps, who participated in a clinical trial testing the effects of piroxicam on rectal mucosal PGE, levels. Only nonusers of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications were eligible for the trial. A study schema is shown in Figure 10.1.For the cross-sectional studies, PGE, concentration was measured in rectal mucosal biopsies collected during the run-in period at visits one and two prior to randomization. A self-administered questionnaire collected at baseline was used to assess leisure-time activity and to calculate a commonly used energy expenditure score from the activities reported. Results showed that a higher level of leisure-time physical activity was significantly inversely related to PGE2 concentration in rectal mucosa . Based on the results of the statisticalFIGURE 10.1 Piroxicam study schema. Biopsies 1 and 2 were used for cross-sectional study and biopsies 3, 4, and 5 were used for prospective study .model, an increase in activity level from 5.2 to 27.7 MET-hours/week was associated with a 28% decrease in levels of PGE2. This change in activity is approximately equal to 1 hour of walking or 30 minutes of jogging or other aerobic exercise per day. The results were consistent when total time per week spent in leisure-time activities was used instead of MET-hours/week, further strengthening the findings.In addition, a positive association between body mass index , a measure of obesity, and PGE2 levels was shown . In this setting, it is possible that BMI is merely a marker for physical activity because active individuals tend to be leaner than inactive ones . However, when physical activity and BMI were included in the same statistical model, the results for each variable were unchanged, suggesting an independent effect of each factor on PGE2 levels.Our published study comprised cross-sectional analyses, so it was not possible to assess temporality of the association. Therefore prospective analyses of these data were conducted after the trial results were published. Because of the beneficial effects of the piroxicam intervention on PGE2 levels , analyses were limited to the control group . As shown in Figure 10.1, three biopsy samples were taken after randomization. As was done in the cross-sectional analyses, PGE2 concentration at the three time points was modeled using a maximum-likelihood repeated measures model. Results of these analyses showed that a higher level of leisure-time physical activity was significantly inversely related to PGE2 concentration , indicating that an increase in activity level from 5.2 to 27.7 MET-hours/week was associated with an 18% decrease in levels of PGE2. Although a positive association between BMI and PGE2 was observed, this was not statistically significant . The prospective data support the cross-sectional analyses, indicating that higher physical activity levels are significantly associated with lower PGE, concentrations in rectal mucosa.The overall significance of rectal mucosal PGE2 to colorectal cancer risk is unknown; no evidence to date directly links rectal mucosal PGE2 levels to the development of colon cancer development. Furthermore, although one study showed that PGE, levels in the upper rectum are correlated with those in the remainder of the colon , this requires further study. Nonetheless, given the current knowledge of increased prostaglandin production in human colonic tumor cells, these data support the potential for PGE2 playing a role in the protective mechanism of physical activity on risk of colon cancer. Whether this is a direct role of prostaglandins is unknown.It is also possible that this effect is linked to production of insulin or the regulation of insulinlike growth factors because it has been shown that prostaglandins of the E series are capable of stimulating insulin secretion and that insulin-like growth factor 1 synthesis is regulated by PGE2 as well as other agents that stimulate cAMP . Also, as noted earlier, the study population comprised nonusers of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; therefore, it is not known whether these findings are applicable to users of these drugs.It was hoped that these findings would stimulate further work in this area. However, to our knowledge, these results have not been replicated. At least one intervention study testing the effect of exercise on colon and rectal cell markers, including prostaglandins, has been conducted - the APPEAL Study . Details of this study are found in Chapter 12. Briefly, 102 men and 100 women were randomized to an intervention or a control group. The intervention comprised a 1-year period of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise intervention, with a goal of 60 minutes per day, 6 days per week. Adherence to this intensive program was excellent, with 85% of participants meeting 80% or more of their goals. The control group was given the opportunity to participant in exercise classes for 2 months at the end of the 1-year period. Final results pertaining to the PGE2 findings are expected to be available in 2006.Strenuous exercise has been shown to produce acute increase in prostaglandin levels , including PGE2 . In a study involving trained runners, participants were placed on 15, 30, or 40% energy from fat for 4 weeks and were exposed to running to exhaustion at 80% of their VO2 max in the last week of the dietary regimen. A series of markers, including PGE, were measured in plasma before and after the run. It was hypothesized that a low-fat diet would result in higher PGE, prior to and after the endurance run compared to the high-fat diets.Results of the study showed that pre-exercise plasma PGE, levels of participants in the 40% diet were significantly lower than those in the lower fat diets. Furthermore, PGE, levels were significantly higher after the endurance run compared to levels before the run among all participants, regardless of dietary regimen; thus, fat intake had no effect on the plasma postexercise PGE, levels. Furthermore, the postexercise PGE2 level was significantly lower on the 40% fat diet compared to the 15% diet, which led the investigators to conclude that dietary fat helps reduce stress caused by exercise and has few adverse effects in well-trained athletes. The overall relevance of these acute responses in prostaglandin concentrations to risk of colorectal cancer, however, is unknown.\n",

      "In conclusion, the results of a single cross-sectional study show a significant reduction in rectal mucosal PGE, concentration associated with a higher level of leisure-time physical activity and a lower BMI. Furthermore, follow-up prospective analyses of this study also support the inverse association between physical activity and PGE, levels. To our knowledge, these findings have not been replicated; however, results of the APPEAL intervention study should provide stronger evidence for the direct effect of physical activity on a variety of markers in rectal mucosa, including prostaglandins.As can be appreciated, much work is needed in this important area of colon cancer prevention research. Studies linking levels of PGE, and other prostanoids in various tissues, including rectal mucosa, to the development of colorectal cancer are needed to validate these biomarkers. If they are successful, concentrations of these markers could be used to assess biologically plausible mechanistic effects of various lifestyle factors. Furthermore, these surrogate biomarkers can be useful to assess drug dosage and compliance in prevention trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and other agents, including those such as the APPEAL study, whose mechanism of action is exerted via prostaglandins.\n",

      "Studies of the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis have used a variety of animal models, including chemically induced tumors, transplantable tumors, spontaneous tumor models, and transgenic and induced-mutant mice, in addition to experimental metastasis models . Many of the studies have identified some form of protective effect of voluntary or involuntary exercise on carcinogenesis, although more recent studies have been less consistent . To the detriment of the field, the number of studies has not increased dramatically over the years and, perhaps more importantly, few studies have really focused on potential mechanisms that might explain the exercise effects.Mechanisms most commonly cited as potential mediators include enhanced antioxidant defense, reductions in body fat, decreases in reproductive hormones, enhanced immunity, or a change in insulin-like growth factor-1 and its related binding proteins, some of which could be acting through similar pathways . There are also site-specific mechanisms for various cancers, such as a decreased colonic transit time in relation to colon cancer. Many of the mechanisms that have received more attention in humans have not received much focus in exercised animal models and vice versa . Some of the more intriguing proposed mechanisms will be examined here.FIGURE 11.1 Commonly cited potential mechanisms for the effects of physical activity and exercise on carcinogenesis. Factors may work in the initial or promotion/progression phases of the disease, and they may act directly or through other intermediates.\n",

      "Animal models have the benefit of a short time for the development of cancer, so training the animal until the development of the disease is feasible. Unfortunately, few studies that have used a training approach have also examined potential mechanisms within that same study or model. Therefore, evidence for the potential mechanisms, as with studies in humans, largely comes from a synthesis of data from studies in which exercise training's effects on biomarkers or potential risk factors are examined separately from studies looking at the association between the marker or mediator and a cancer endpoint. When examined in this fashion, the strength of the association between exercise and the mechanistic factor, as well as that between the mechanistic factor and disease, is important .The evidence to be addressed in this review will focus largely on the first types of studies, if available , and then on studies that have looked at associations between exercise and the potential mediator . We will largely not consider the strength of the evidence for associations between the mediator and the cancer outcome. An additional caveat to this review isFIGURE 11.2 Conceptual framework for how a mechanism can be evaluated. In option A, which is currently limited to animal models, one can examine mechanisms in the context of a cancer endpoint. In option B, which can use animal, human, or cell culture experiments, the links between exercise and the mediator, and the mediator and the cancer outcome, are examined independently. The strength of the proposed mechanism depends on both relationships in this type of approach.that effects of chronic exercise training will be considered rather than the effects of acute bouts of exercise. Although the latter may have some effect on carcinogenesis, the effects of regular, chronic activity or exercise on basal levels of the mediators may be more relevant when considering the carcinogenic process.\n",

      "Reactive oxygen species can play a significant role in carcinogenesis via their ability to produce DNA damage as well as damage to other cellular components that interact with DNA . The idea that endogenous sources of these reactive oxygen species may play a bigger role in carcinogenesis than exogenous sources is particularly relevant to exercise research because the increased metabolism associated with acute exercise can be a significant source of free radical generation . Fortunately, the body has a battery of antioxidant enzymes as well as nonenzymatic repair systems that work to prevent and/or repair the damage induced by reactive oxygen species, and chronic exercise training may be an important stimulus to upregulate these systems .To date, few studies have examined reactive oxygen species-related damage or relevant antioxidant enzymes in the context of exercise in a cancer model. One study has examined wheel running in a tumor-bearing rat model and its effects on coenzymes Q and Q10 in skeletal muscle because exercise in this same model had been found to delay cancer-induced cachexia . Both enzymes appeared to be upregulated in anterior tibialis muscle, and O., also in the soleus. We have just completed our first studies of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and the 8-epiprostaglandin F20 isoprostane in a transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer and have found largely unchanged values. The exception is a decrease in excreted 8-PGF2α in wheelrun compared to sedentary mice coupled with no effect of the wheel running on tumor-specific survival .Exercise studies to date have largely focused on tissues relevant to exercise and not necessarily those tissues relevant to common human cancers . One group, however, examined antioxidant defense mechanisms in relevant tissues following a 10-week treadmill training program in rats; they found that superoxide dismutase and catalase were upregulated with exercise in the lung, and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase was upregulated in liver and lung . Radak et al. also reported a decrease in reactive oxygen species production in the liver following 8 weeks of treadmill training in Fischer 344 rats .Given the wide array of relevant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; relevant nonenzymatic proteins such as the heat shock proteins and hemoxygenase-1; the various techniques and measures used to evaluate antioxidant status and/or DNA damage; and the variety of animal models and exercise protocols, it will clearly be difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding this factor as an anticancer mechanism for exercise until many more studies have been conducted. Despite this, evidence is accumulating to suggest that chronic exercise training promotes beneficial effects in many animal antioxidant systems .\n",

      "One frequently cited mechanism for the association between activity and cancer prevention in humans is a decrease in body weight or obesity as a result of exercise, which would subsequently work through further \"downstream\" targets such as estrogen metabolism, inflammation, or insulin sensitivity. In animals, calorie restriction has long been known to have sigmificant effects on body size and carcinogenesis . Consequently, a reasonable hypothesis is that loss of body mass through exercise might also result in a reduction or delay in carcinogenesis. Few studies have actually examined body composition; however, body weights have frequently been recorded with training. Whether weight loss and/or body fat reductions are achieved can depend largely on the training protocol used, diet consumed, and the animal model and sex of the animal used. Table 11.1 is a summary of studies addressing the effects of exercise in various cancer models in which body weight and/or composition was also assessed. Mammary tumor studies have dominated the literature in this area, with the majority of studies cited using chemically induced carcinogenesis.Only one group to date has used voluntary wheel running in mammary models; in each of the studies, all the animals were placed on high-fat diets . In the studies using 1methyl 1-nitrosurea in F344 rats, body weight in the exercised animals was increased compared to that of sedentary rats ; however, in a study of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene in Sprague-Dawley rats, the voluntary exercise resulted in lower body weights . In all three studies, the trend was for lower body fat with the exercise. Despite the differences in body weight, the exercise beneficially affected carcinogenesis in all of the studies. Time to tumor formation was delayed in both models, adenocarcinoma incidence was decreased in the MNUtreated F344 rats , and total tumor number was decreased in the DMBA-treated Sprague-Dawley rats .Among the studies using treadmill exercise, results are quite variable concerning the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis as well as on body weight and composition. Increases in body weight with treadmill exercise have led to increased incidence of tumors . In one of these studies, in which a high-fat diet was given, body fat was increased with the exercise ; however, in the other study, body fat was not different from that of the sedentary rats . Studies in which exercise had no effect on body weight have had varied results: decreased tumor multiplicity or incidence , no effect on tumor incidence or multiplicity , increase in the tumor growth rate , or decrease in the tumor growth rate . Perhaps the most important point to be derived from a review of these studies is that no consistent relationship between the effects of exercise on body weight/composition and its effect on carcinogenesis has been found.In terms of intestinal cancers in rodents, Thorling et al. found that a substantial volume of exercise resulted in lower body weight and body fat along with a decreased incidence of adenomas, but not carcinomas . Reddy et al., on the other hand, saw no effect of voluntary wheel running on body weight in rats, but a significant decreased incidence of colonic adenocarcinomas, but not adenomas . We have looked at polyp development following treadmill exercise in the Min mouse, an induced mutant mouse in which an APC tumor suppressor gene mutation results in multiple intestinal polyps . In ad libitum fed animals, body weights were unchanged by exercise, and polyp development was not significantly affected .In a follow-up experiment, exercised mice were pair-fed with the sedentary control mice in order to produce a negative energy balance due solely to the exercise. Body weights in the exercised mice were significantly lower in the last few weeks of the study compared to control mice, and body fat was significantly lower in female exercised mice compared to female controls . Despite the negative energy balance, total polyp number was not affected in males or females by exercise, and there was only a suggestion of a decrease in jejunal polyps with exercise in the male mice. Therefore, although limited in number, studies of exercise effects on intestinal tumors have not been consistent in regard to body weight or fatness as a mediating effect of exercise.So far, the data on body weight with exercise in pancreatic cancer models suggest that this factor may be somewhat important. In the three studies identified to date, exercise appeared ineffective in only one of the studies, which also showed a lack of change in body weight . For liver cancer models, however, all three identified studies found that exercise decreased tumor incidence or burden , with a decrease in body weight only found in one study .To date, the various models of exercise and carcinogenesis suggest that the negative energy balance created by exercise is not a likely mechanism of cancer prevention in these animals, with the possible exception of pancreatic cancer. This is consistent with studies of caloric restriction and exercise effects on aging. Holloszy demonstrated that, although voluntary exercise in Long-Evans rats increased average lifespan, it did not increase maximal lifespan as calorie restric-Cancer model MNU 37.5 mg/kg body T body wgt vs Sed; trend wards ↓ body fat in Ex Cohen et al., 1988, 1991 MNO 50 of 25 - MNU lopment and ↓ tumor vth rate with no effect fence or multiplic ite and wgt delayed time to tunอุธยายอย วัย อธิร wgt — female Cancer mode MNU 37.5 Azaserine 30 mg/kg body diff in no. of preneoplast Tumor effect ect on adenom y wgt/body fat effAzaserine 90 mg/kg body No differences in body wgt; No significant reduction in perirenal fat pad ↓ in Ex = preneoplastic foci with Ex; Roebuck Giles and NU = 1-melhyl 1-nirosurex, Ex = execise, Sed = sedentary; CR = calorie restriction; DMBA = 7,12-dimethylbenzantlmacene; wgt = weigh; BOP, N-niroso\n",

      "tion did . Additionally, the combination of exercise and calorie restriction extended lifespan to the same degree that calorie restriction alone did. Holloszy concluded that those results, as well as results from a prior study , suggested that caloric restriction acts, at least on aging, through some other consequence of caloric restriction aside from the energy deficit that it creates.A recent statistical analysis of caloric restriction on longevity in Wistar rats concluded that changes in body weight could only account for ~1 1% of the effects of caloric restriction on longevity . Similarly, it is quite possible that the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis are largely independent of its effects on energy balance. Unfortunately, the limited evidence to date in animal models of exercise is not yet conclusive; few studies have attempted to control both sides of the energy balance equation. Additionally, many of the studies of mammary cancer have used young animals, which may not be relevant as models of the exercise effects in postmenopausal women because mice and rats cease cycling around ~12 and ~19 months of age, respectively . Clearly, more studies are needed in which energy expenditure and energy intake are manipulated in young and older animals to examine the resultant outcomes definitively in terms of body weight, body composition, and carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Changes in steroid hormone levels - estrogen and testosterone in particular - are perhaps the most consistently cited potential mechanism for the association of physical activity with breast and prostate cancer. Relatively few studies have been conducted in rodents, perhaps due to the difficulties in measuring these hormones at specific times in the considerably shorter reproductive cvcle in rodents, which averages ~4 to 6 days . Nonetheless, results suggest that, in younger rodents, exercise training must be of a considerable volume and/or intensity in order to disrupt regular cycling and estrogen levels.A 12-week treadmill training program in 8-week-old Harlan Sprague–Dawley rats resulted in lower estradiol levels and an anestrous state in 5 of 16 exercised animals compared to no changes in the 16 sedentary rats . Through this progressive training protocol, animals were running 4 h/day, 7 days/week, at 30 to 38 m/min, up a 10 to 15% grade by the end of the program. It cannot be discerned, in this case, whether the disruptions were a result of the volume of training or its intensity, although the ad libitum fed exercised animals did not differ in weight at the end of the protocol compared to the controls. Eight weeks of 5 days/week, 2.5-h swims combined with access to running wheels resulted in a decrease in estradiol levels and disruption of regular cycling in CDstrain rats; this was accompanied by lower body weights as well as weights of the ovarian fat pads .In contrast, 8 weeks of a more moderate exercise training did not alter body weight or estradiol levels in 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats , although mesenteric and subcutaneous levels of body fat were lower in the trained vs. untrained rats . Similarly, a 12-week moderate treadmill training program in 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats had no effect on estradiol or progesterone . This latter study is the only one to examine hormones in the context of a model used to study exercise effects on tumorigenesis. This same treadmill training program was repeated in a separate study in which rats of the same age received low or high doses of the carcinogen MNU . Although exercise had no effect on tumor-free survival time, incidence, or tumor multiplicity, it did result in lower tumor weights and growth rates.Results are not as consistent in older or ovariectomized animals. Moderate treadmill training for 8 weeks in 26-week-old Wistar rats resulted in significantly lower estradiol and progesterone levels . Body weights also appeared lower vs. control animals, although the significance of the difference was not reported. In ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats of the same age and exercised in a similar training program to the previous study, the training had no effect on estradiol levels or body weight . Voluntary wheel running for 3 weeks had no effect on body weight or estrogenOne primate study was identified that was consistent with the suggestion of a high training volume necessary for disturbance of the reproductive hormones. Adult cytomolgous monkeys were progressively trained on a treadmill until they were running approximately 12 km/day , 7 days/week . All eight of the exercised monkeys became amenorrheic but none of the eight control monkeys did. The time to develop the amenorrhea varied considerably, with a range of 7 to 24 months. Lutenizing hormone and progesterone were lower during the amenorrhea as well as during the month preceding it; estradiol was only significantly lower during the amenorthea. Surprisingly, despite this large volume of running, the body weights of the monkeys were reported not to change, although food intake was reported to remain constant.Collectively, these studies appear reasonably consistent in demonstrating a need for high volumes or intensities of activity in order to disrupt luteal function. Although body weights were reported, few attempts were made to disentangle the effects of exercise from those of energy balance in general. This has been shown to be important in humans, in whom it appears that negative energy balance and not physical activity per se can alter reproductive hormones in young women .One of the mechanisms suggested for the potentially decreased risk of prostate cancer with activity is a reduction in testosterone levels. To date, no studies of exercise in an animal model of prostate cancer have been published. In rodent models in general, evidence is quite inconsistent in terms of exercise effects on testosterone levels. With varying exercise training protocols and rodent species, basal testosterone levels have been found to increase , decrease , or remain unchanged after the training program; however, the changes may depend on how many weeks into the training the hormone is assayed .\n",

      "Along with body composition and energy balance, immune function has been the area most studied in relation to the potential affects of exercise on cancer outcomes. Most tumor-related models to date have looked at immunity in models of metastasis or implanted tumors. This review will focus on studies that have examined immunity in the context of a cancer model or immunity to cancer cells in vitro. Excellent reviews have already been produced on the effects of acute and chronic exercise on potentially relevant immune markers such as natural killer cells, other lymphocytes, and macrophages .Several studies have examined exercise effects on immune function in the context of implanted tumors. In only one case did moderate exercise training reduce the growth of the tumor and, in this case, the survival of the rats . Lymphocyte proliferative responses were also increased in the trained rats. In other studies, final tumor weights or volumes were unaffected by the various exercise regimens despite increases in various immune functions such as splenocyte mitogen response and phagocytic activity of macrophages . One study examined the growth and regression of allogeneic EL-4 lymphoma cells and found that repeated strenuous exercise delayed the time to peak tumor volume and resulted in a quicker regression of the tumor . This latter study found fewer inflammatory cells within the tumors as well as a decrease in angiogenesis .Many studies have examined exercise effects on experimental tumor metastasis models in association with innate immune cell activity. An acute bout of exhaustive exercise and 6 days of hour-long bouts of higher intensity exercise have been found to decrease the number of lung tumor foci following intravenous injection of B16 melanoma cells . In both studies, the same exercise was found to increase macrophage cytotoxicity against the same tumor in vitro. Additionally, studies with other models of exercise have found that chronic and short-term repeated bouts of acute exercise can increase macrophage antitumoral cytotoxicity in vitro . Collectively, the studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of many types of exercise on macrophage function and, in the two cases examined, on experimental lung tumor metastasis.Studies looking at natural killer cell activity in relation to tumor retention have been less consistent in terms of the tumor outcome relating to the in vitro cell function. Several studies have identified a beneficial effect of exercise training on splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity or on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity . Additionally, tumor cell retention in the lungs following intravenous injection - considered by some to be a marker of natural killer cell activity - has frequently been found to be reduced with exercise training , although this effect may depend on the aggressiveness of the tumor used in the assay .Unfortunately, these apparently beneficial effects on immunity have not translated into a reduction in lung tumor metastasis . These results may not agree for a number of reasons, including differences in the tumor cell lines, the comparison of splenic natural killer activity to metastasis at another organ site, or the assumption that lung retention of tumors is a marker of natural killer activity. It is more likely, however, that any effect of exercise on the complex process of lung tumor metastasis will likely involve more than one immune cell as well as other processes not directly related to innate immune cell cytotoxicity, such as cell adhesion, inflammation, and angiogenesis.Nonetheless, the data in animals are promising in the sense that exercise of many types and intensities appears to have beneficial effects on innate immunity that may be important in cancer prevention. Prior studies have primarily used transplanted tumors and intravenous injection of tumor cells as a model of metastasis. What are needed are more studies of exercise training-induced changes in immunity in the context of different cancer models including spontaneous, chemically induced, or genetically modified carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Within the past several years, insulin-like growth factor-1 and its related binding proteins have received considerable attention as potential mediators of the protective effects of physical activity on cancer incidence. Although the evidence that IGF-1 is relevant to carcinogenesis is convincing , the link between physical activity and IGF-1 is quite inconsistent and, in the case of animals, quite limited. One group has nicely demonstrated with liver-specific IGF-1-deficient transgenic mice that circulating IGF-1 is important in colon and mammary carcinogenesis . Additionally, another group has shown in various models that a decrease in circulating IGF-1 mediates, in part, the effect of caloric restriction on carcinogenesis .It is overly simplistic to assume that because caloric restriction and exercise can result in a negative energy balance, exercise may also act on carcinogenesis via a lowering of IGF-1. In fact, given that IGF-1 functions in protein synthesis and is associated with the development of lean mass , one would expect that IGF-1 might be increased early in exercise training in order to increase lean mass. Unfortunately, the variety of exercise protocols, heterogeneity of subjects, and timing and type of IGF-1 measurements have resulted in an unclear association even in humans . As previously mentioned, data in animals are much more limited, particularly in regard to exercise training and circulating IGF-1.In a model of carcinogen-induced pancreatic cancer, Syrian hamsters with access to running wheels had IGF-1 levels that were no different than those of controls at three time points across the experiment . In this study, insulin levels were also examined and found to be lower in the exercised mice that were also on a high-fat corn-oil diet compared to their high-fat diet controls. Neither in high- or low-fat fed animals, however, did the wheel running affect the incidence or multiplicity of tumors. This is consistent with a study we have recently completed that examined moderate- and vigorous-intensity treadmill running as well as wheel running in a transgenic mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis. We measured IGF-1 at two to three timepoints during the study and found no differences in IGF-1 by group . Similar to the pancreatic cancer study, no beneficial effect of the exercise on tumor outcomes was found. In theIn one other study, rats were run on a treadmill with and without added weight for 5 weeks to examine the effect on various bone growth factors. No difference was found between the exercise and control conditions on circulating IGF-1 measured at the end of the 5 weeks . Collectively, these experiments suggest that exercise training does not appear to affect basal levels of IGF-1 in various rodent models, although clearly the evidence in this area is limited.\n",

      "Proliferation, apoptosis, and structure of organs can all determine susceptibility to and/or the progression of cancer. It was hypothesized in the late 1980s that total cell number and cellular proliferation could be risk factors for cancer; some of the underlying evidence was the increased cancer risk associated with body weight and height and the decreased risk with calorie restriction . Indeed, the balance between cellular proliferation and programmed cell death, or apoptosis, plays a role in the carcinogenic process . In terms of breast cancer, in particular, mammographic density, which is indicative of the relative amount of stroma and epithelium compared to fat tissue in the breast, is considered an important marker of breast cancer risk .Westerlind et al. proposed that the beneficial effects of exercise on mammary carcinogenesis in rats may be to alter the glands during the critical window between sexual maturity and first pregnancy . In particular, the study examined the terminal end buds that are the mammary structures most susceptible to carcinogens . Moderate exercise training begun at 28 days of age in Sprague-Dawley rats had no effect on body weight or growth, age at sexual maturation , or the number of terminal end buds. Cellular proliferation in the mammary gland, as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry, was higher at 42 through 70 days of age in the exercising animals. Apoptosis, assessed by counting apoptotic cells in stained gland sections, was also higher in the exercised rats at 70 days of age and, nonsignificantly, at 84 days of age.In a similar study, 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent moderate treadmill exercise training until 50 days of age, at which time some were sacrificed for the examination of mammary development and proliferation. The rest received a 50-mg/kg dose of NMU and were followed for 24 more weeks . The exercise training did not alter body weight, mammary gland development, or cellular proliferation. Although exercise did not affect tumor incidence, it did result in a reduction in total tumor number as well as the number of tumors per rat. In a repeat experiment with a lower dose of NMU , exercise still did not affect incidence, no longer had an effect on tumor multiplicity, and actually increased the growth rate of the tumors .\n",

      "To date, few studies have examined potential mechanisms of an exercise-induced decrease in carcinogenesis within the same experiment or model system. Although body size and fatness have received the most attention, the evidence is largely unsupportive of an energy balance-mediated reduction in cancer risk with exercise. One possible exception is pancreatic cancer, although only three studies have evaluated this. Rodent studies suggest an enhancement of antioxidant defense systems with chronic, moderate training, although few studies have looked at tissues that may be most relevant to carcinogenesis.Similar to the findings in studies in younger women, it appears that high-volume or highintensity exercise training is necessary to lower estrogen levels in animals or to disrupt cycling. It is not completely clear whether these effects are due to a reduction in total energy reserves or tothe exercise. Innate immunity appears to be enhanced with exercise training in rodent models; however, frequently, this enhanced immunity has not coincided with a reduction in tumor burden or metastasis. There is very little evidence to date to evaluate the potential role of IGF-1 in the exercise and cancer relationship. Finally, studies have not found an influence on mammary gland development, which could be relevant to breast cancer, although it appears that some changes with cellular proliferation take place.\n",

      "As described in Chapter 4 through Chapter 6, epidemiological studies have shown that increased physical activity is associated with decreased risk for several cancers. Yet, the amount, type, and intensity of physical activity needed are unknown. Furthermore, the effect of an increase in activity levels in previously sedentary persons is unknown. Finally, the mechanisms through which exercise might reduce cancer risk are unproven in humans.Intervention studies can help to answer some of these open questions in cancer prevention . Through intervention studies, researchers can test the effect of one or more specific exercise prescriptions on disease biomarkers or disease. In monitored interventions , the researcher can be assured that the individual actually performed the exercise, and the length and intensity of the exercise can be accurately measured. It is easier to control the effects of confounding factors such as other health behaviors in intervention studies, which makes such studies a useful addition to other human research such as epidemiological observational studies.With intervention studies, researchers can assess the effect of increase in exercise on risk factors for cancer; this is very difficult to assess in observational studies because the population trend is for people to decrease physical activity over time rather than to increase it. Furthermore, intervention studies designed to study cancer risks can include exercise programs that are likely to be most relevant to cancer, such as aerobic exercise and colon cancer risk, conditioning for cancer patients, etc. Selected populations, such as persons at high risk for cancer, of different age groups, or of different racial or ethnic backgrounds, can be studied to determine exercise effects on the biology in different settings.Finally, intervention studies can focus on cancer patients and survivors, whose physical abilities and needs are different from most other patient and healthy population groups. Such intervention studies can focus on rehabilitation for such individuals, biological effects relevant to survival, or both.This chapter reviews the exercise intervention studies that have been designed and conducted to focus on cancer prevention-related endpoints. It does not include the trials conducted in cancer patients - those will be covered in Chapter 25 through Chapter 28. A number of trials have been focused on exercise effects on endpoints related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or aging. These are not covered in depth in this chapter, but may be included in other chapters dealing with specific factors such as exercise effect on insulin or sex hormones.\n",

      "Exercise intervention studies related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases have a rich history; however, very few such studies related to cancer have been conducted. Intervention studies focused on cancer can concentrate on the exercise type, dose, and frequency most relevant to cancer. These studies can focus on persons at high risk for cancer . Exercise intervention studies can assess exercise effects on biological endpoints most relevant to cancer etiology and prevention.This is not to dismiss the important knowledge that can be gained from intervention studies originally focused on other diseases. For example, several studies point to etiological roles for insulin, insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins, and risk for cancer. Many exercise intervention studies have addressed the effects of various types of exercise on insulin levels in various age, gender, race/ethnic, and other demographic groups. A smaller number of studies have assessed exercise effects on various IGFs and their binding proteins . The information from these studies can be applied to the cancer prevention field, although studies will still be needed to confirm these associations in persons at elevated risk for cancer and in persons who already have a diagnosis of cancer.\n",

      "Several studies have looked at exercise training effects on ovulatory and menstrual patterns in girls and young women . Some but not all of these studies have found that exercise increases menstrual cycle length, suppresses ovulation, and lowers estrogen and progesterone levels. One found that weight loss was necessary to cause changes in reproductive factors in young women . These reproductive effects are relevant to etiology of several cancers — most notably breast and endometrium - because lowered numbers of ovulatory menstrual cycles and lowered levels of estrogen are associated with lower risk of developing these cancers.Several clinical trials have assessed exercise effects on insulin as a biomarker of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in relation to exercise . Other trials have assessed the effect of exercise interventions on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 as possible mechanisms linking exercise effects on the aging process with variable results . One recently published randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of a 10-month strength-training program on IGF and IGFBP in 54 women aged 30 to 50 years and found that, after 15 weeks, the subjects randomized to the strength-training program experienced a decrease in IGF-1 of -30.47 ng/mL vs. an increase of 5.86 ng/mL in controls . After 10 months, IGF-1 returned to baseline levels in the treatment group, but remained 15% lower in treatment compared to control participants. The study found no effect of the strengthtraining program on IGFBP-1 and -3.A 6-month endurance exercise trial in 21 older women did not change IGF-1 concentrations in exercisers when compared with controls . A small trial found that an 8-week endurance exercise program produced a small, nonsignificant increase in IGF-1 concentrations in older women . As summarized in an excellent review by Orenstein and Friedenreich, little evidence of an effect of exercise on insulin-like growth factors has been found .There is a growing literature of small intervention studies that have assessed the effect of exercise on immune function , with varied effects. The role of immune function in cancer etiology is unclear, but certainly several cancers have immune components, including lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical cancer, and other cancers caused by infectious agents. The effect of exercise on immune function and inflammatory markers is covered in depth in Chapter 9.\n",

      "The APPEAL Study is testing the effect of a moderate intensity exercise program on colon and rectal cell proliferation, apoptosis, and prostaglandins in men and women . Other study endpoints include metabolic hormones , weight, and adipose tissue stores .The APPEAL study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 102 men and 100 women between the ages of 40 and 75 years were randomized. To be eligible, men and women must have had a colonoscopy within the previous 3 years. The sample is over-representative of persons with a history of adenomatous colon polyps and persons with a first-degree family history of colorectal cancer . Participants must also have been physically inactive , drink less than two alcohol drinks per day, nondiabetic, and with no personal history of invasive cancer.Participants were recruited to the APPEAL study through several methods. The primary recruitment method was through gastroenterologists' practices, in which persons who had had a colonoscopy in the past 3 years were identified and sent an invitation letter from their physician with an enclosed Interest Survey to complete and return. Additional recruitment methods included media placements, flyers, a study website, and referrals.From the 9828 letters mailed to gastroenterology practice patients, 2033 responded with interest in joining the study and, of these, 956 were potentially eligible. These 956 persons were interviewed by phone regarding eligibility requirements and 240 were preliminarily eligible. In addition, 1328 calls were made to the study line in response to media placements, of which 1092 interviews were completed and 107 were preliminarily eligible. The major reasons for ineligibility were because a respondent was not interested in being randomly assigned to exercise or control groups, was too physically active, or did not have time available to attend classes . After extensive screening, 102 men and 100 women were enrolled in the trial and randomized to exercise or control .The intervention was a 1-year, moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise program. The goal was 60 minutes per day, 6 days per week. The intervention included both gym-based and home-based exercise programs. Participants met in classes to exercise with an exercise specialist in attendance 3 days per week. Four facilities were available to participants and three private health clubs .At the facilities, participants performed aerobic exercise for 45 minutes per session on machines . They also performed some limited weight-training exercises, which were personalized according to the participants' needs and interests. Warm-up, cool-down, and stretching exercise completed the exercise sessions.Participants also were asked to exercise at home 3 days per week. Some of the study facilities provided the opportunity for participants to work out during any open hours, so some participants did their home exercise as unsupervised gym workouts using various machines. Other participants chose outdoor walking or jogging as their primary home exercise. An additional part of the intervention was a series of monthly behavior change classes in which participants met individually or in a group with an exercise physiologist trained in behavior change techniques. In these meetings, participants discussed issues and challenges to exercise adherence and came up with strategies to overcome challenges.Several strategies were used to increase and maintain adherence to the exercise program. The exercise specialists met individually with participants every month to review progress and to address any particular adherence problems with that participant. Graphs showing study goals and individual performance were shared with the participant, and discrepancies between the two were discussed. Participant adherence was monitored by the study staff and principal investigator weekly through automated reports from weekly downloads of participants' daily exercise log data . Participants with adherence problems were discussed in depth, and strategies for improvement were discussed. Quarterly newsletters were sent to participants with tips on exercise and news on study progress. Small incentives were included, such as giving participants pedometers or water bottles after certain goals were met. Finally, group activities such as hikes and snowshoeing were arranged.Several methods were used to measure and monitor adherence, including facility class attendance , home exercise logs, quarterly total physical activity questionnaires, VO, max treadmill tests , and pedometers recording daily steps .Adherence to the program was excellent, with 80% of participants meeting 80% or more of their goal of 360 exercise minutes per week. On average, the participants met 91% of their goal minutes per week of exercise. Only seven individuals dropped out of the exercise program. The control group was given the opportunity to participate in exercise classes for 2 months at the end of the 1-year period.Analyses of study specimens for proliferation, apoptosis, and prostaglandins are under way. Final primary results should be available in 2005. Several ancillary studies are in place or under consideration, including an ongoing study to assess the effect of exercise on subjective and objective sleep measures, a study measuring exercise effect on proteomics, a study of exercise effect on mammogram density in women, and a study of exercise effect on testosterone and other sex hormones in men. In addition, blood and biopsy specimens are being stored for potential future uses.\n",

      "The ALPHA Trial is a randomized controlled trial examining how a 1-year aerobic exercise intervention, as compared to a usual sedentary lifestyle, influences specific biological mechanisms hypothesized to be operative in the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk . Proposed biological mechanisms include an effect on endogenous sex hormones, obesity and central adiposity, mammographic density, insulin and insulin-like growth factors, and immune function. The ALPHA Trial is examining the effect of physical activity on several biological mechanisms in a controlled trial setting. The ALPHA Trial is the first such study in Canada and only the second worldwide.A two-centered, two-armed randomized controlled trial of exercise and intermediate endpoints for breast cancer is being conducted. The study is recruiting 334 postmenopausal, sedentary women from the provincial breast screening program in Alberta. Participants are randomized to an exercise intervention or a control group. The intervention group will undertake 60-minute exercise sessions five times/week for 12 months; the control group will be asked not to change their usual level of activity. No change in dietary intake will be made for either group.Baseline and 12-month assessments will be made of changes in serum sex hormones, obesity and adiposity, mammographic density, insulin-like growth factors, insulin resistance, aerobic capacity, psychosocial health measures, and potential covariates. These assessments will combine questionnaire data with direct biological and physical testing. Adherence to the exercise intervention is enhanced by several measures, including individual, ongoing counseling with on-site trainers who design an exercise program appropriate for the fitness level of the participant that interests her.Intention-to-treat analyses will be performed to determine how physical activity changes these intermediate endpoints for breast cancer. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide evidencebased data for guidelines on physical activity for breast cancer risk reduction.\n",

The design is a 12-month randomized controlled trial with four study arms: dietary weight loss alone, exercise alone, dietary weight loss plus exercise, and control. The exercise intervention consists of combined facility and home exercise: 45 minutes of aerobic activity, five times/week. The diet is a modification of the Diabetes Prevention Program diet , with goals of <25% calories from fat, a caloric deficit of about 500 kcal/day, and a 7% loss of initial body weight.\n",

      "More exercise intervention clinical trials are needed to provide much needed information. Future exercise intervention studies should test different types of exercise, various intensities of exercise, different frequencies of activity, and intermittent vs. continuous exercise effects. Different populations and age groups should be studied because the effects of exercise may vary by age, gender, race, ethnicity, geography, and culture. Persons at varying risks of developing cancer should be studied because exercise may have different types and magnitudes of effects in persons at high vs. low risk of cancer. Finally, novel biomarkers of cancer risk should be studied.The clinical trials and other intervention studies reviewed in this chapter make the assumption that the biomarker endpoints lie in the causal pathway between physical activity and cancer development. If, in fact, the pathways diverge, then assessing the exercise effect on such biomarkers will give an inaccurate picture of the physical activity-cancer picture. The optimal study would be a large-scale randomized clinical trial testing the effect of exercise on disease endpoints, such as that being done to test the effect of a low-fat dietary pattern on incidence of breast cancer . Such a trial would be expensive and time-consuming, but could be done more efficiently if several disease endpoints were studied , and its results would have great public health implications.\n",

      "Intervention studies, particularly randomized clinical trials, can provide important information to the knowledge base on the association between physical activity and cancer risk and prognosis. Relatively few such studies have been conducted and more are needed.Previous intervention studies suggest that several hormonal mechanisms might explain the associations between increased physical activity and reduced risk for several types of cancers. These hormones include estrogens, androgens, SHBG, insulin, IGF, and IGFBP. Future advances in this area can be made as novel hormonal cancer biomarkers are identified. A small number of past and ongoing exercise intervention studies suggest that exercise can improve immune function , which could in part explain the exercise-cancer association.Ongoing exercise randomized clinical trials can provide some important information on these and other biomarkers, but more studies are needed to assess different exercise programs in different populations with different biomarkers and other endpoints.\n",

      "The favorable effects of endurance training and physically active lifestyle on the risk of several chronic diseases and their risk factors have been well documented. As presented elsewhere in the book, regular physical activity seems to protect also against several types of cancer. The effects of exercise training and regular physical activity are usually reported and interpreted in terms of group means and these trends are then generalized in the whole population. However, over the last two decades, it has become evident that there are marked interindividual differences in the adaptation to exercise training, even when the exercise stimulus is identical across the subjects. Consequently, a concept of individualized exercise prescription has gained popularity. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concept of interindividual differences in the adaptation to exercise, summarize the contribution of genetic factors to the person to-person variability, and review the available data regarding the genotype-physical activity interactions on cancer.\n",

      "As evidenced by several consensus meetings and expert panel recommendations , the body of scientific evidence regarding physical activity and sedentarism and their effects on risk factors, health outcomes and mortality rates is already impressive and is growing. However, the effects of exercise and physical activity have been almost always tested and reported in terms of main effects and mean group differences. Consequently, the interpretations and conclusions have been based on the average effects observed in groups of subjects. Although means and main effects are effective and convenient ways to summarize large amounts of data, it tends to be forgotten that not all members of the group follow the pattern reflected by the group mean. In fact, considerable individualdifferences are present in the risk factor responses to regular physical activity, even when all subjects are exposed to the same volume of exercise, adjusted for their tolerance levels .The concept of heterogeneity in responsiveness to standardized exercise programs was first introduced in the early 1980s . In a series of carefully controlled and standardized exercise training studies in young and healthy volunteers, it was shown that the individual differences in training-induced changes in several physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes are large, with low and high responders showing 8- to 13-fold differences . The most extensive data on the individual differences in trainability come from the HERITAGE Family Study, in which 742 healthy, but sedentary, subjects followed a highly standardized, well-controlled endurancetraining program for 20 weeks. The average increase in maximal oxygen consumption , a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, was 384 mL O, with an SD of 202. However, the training responses varied from no change to increases of more than 1000 mL O, per minute .A similar pattern of variation in training responses was observed for several other phenotypes, such as plasma lipid levels and submaximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure . For example, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured during steady-state submaximal exercise decreased on average by 7 and 3.5 mmHg, respectively, in response to exercise training . However, the responses varied from marked decreases to no changes or, in some cases, even to slight increases .This kind of variation is an example of normal biological diversity, is observed in most populations, is generally beyond measurement error, and is potentially very informative in terms of the adaptive mechanisms involved . However, only now are the factors contributing to these interindividual differences beginning to be understood.\n",

      "Document 227:\n",
      "The available studies on the interindividual differences in adaptation to regular physical activity have shown that the phenomenon is independent of age, sex, and ethnic background of the subjects . The contribution of the pretraining levels of the response phenotype seems to vary depending on the trait. For example, in the HERITAGE Family Study cohort, baseline VO, max and HDL cholesterol levels explained only about 1% of the variance in the respective training responses. On the other hand, contribution of the pretraining values was much greater for the training-induced changes in submaximal exercise blood pressure, heart rate, and stroke volume, with R-values ranging from 30 to 40% .A common feature for most of the training response phenotypes is that they show significant familial aggregation, i.e., individuals within the same family tend to be more alike in terms of trait values than those from different families. Familial aggregation and maximal heritability of a trait, i.e., the combined effect of genes and shared environment on a phenotype, can be estimated using data from family and twin studies. The heritability estimates are based on comparisons of phenotypic similarities between pairs of relatives with different level of biological relatedness. For example, biological siblings, who share about 50% of their genes identical by descent, should be phenotypically more similar than their parents if genetic factors contribute to the trait of interest. Likewise, a greater phenotypic resemblance between identical twins than between dizygotic twins indicates genetic effect on the phenotype.In pairs of monozygotic twins, the between-identical-twin-pairs variance in response to regular exercise has been reported to be from two to nine times larger than the within-pairs variance for cardiorespiratory fitness, hemodynamic, and metabolic phenotypes . Thus, gains in absolute VQ4 max were much more heterogeneous between pairs of twins than within pairs of twins. In the HERITAGE Family Study, the increase in VO2 max in 481 individuals from 99 two-generation families of Caucasian descent showed 2.6 times more variance between families than within families. Maximum likelihood estimation of familial correlations revealed a maximal heritability estimate of 47% .In addition to VO, max, the heritability of training-induced changes in several other phenotypes, such as submaximal aerobic performance ; resting and submaximal exercise blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output ; body composition and body fat distribution ; and plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels , have been investigated in the HERITAGE Family Study. The maximal heritabilities for these traits ranged from 25 to 55% further confirming the contribution of familial factors to the person-to-person variation in responsiveness to endurance training.\n",

      "The evidence from the genetic enidemiology studies suggests that a genetically determined component affects exercise-related phenotypes. However, because these traits are complex and multifactorial in nature, the search for genes and mutations responsible for the genetic regulation must not only target several families of phenotypes, but also consider the phenotypes in the sedentary state and in response to exercise training.It is also obvious that the research on molecular genetics of exercise-related phenotypes is still in its infancy. For example, the 2003 update of the Human Gene Map for Performance and Health-Related Fitness phenotypes map included 109 gene entries and quantitative trait loci on the autosomes and two on the X chromosome for physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes . As a comparison, the latest version of a similar map for obesity-related phenotypes included more than 330 loci .These numbers demonstrate that relatively little has been accomplished to date. For instance, no gene contributing to human variation in endurance performance has been identified yet as a result of studies based on model organisms. Now that the era in which large fractions of the human, mouse, and rat genomic sequences are available is here, the field of exercise science and sports medicine will need to devote more attention to molecular and genetic research.\n",

      "The majority of the exercise-related molecular genetic studies published so far have utilized a candidate gene approach, i.e., a gene has been targeted based on its potential physiological and metabolic relevance to the trait of interest. Statistical tests for an association are based on the comparison of allele and genotype frequencies of genetic markers between two groups of subjects: one with the phenotype of interest and the other one without . However, with continuous traits, the test is done by comparing mean phenotypic values across genotype groups or between carriers and noncarriers of a specific allele.The genetic data hold great promise to help in understanding why some individuals respond favorably to exercise training in terms of reduction of chronic disease risk factor levels and others do not. The major problem of the candidate gene association studies with multifactorial traits is the lack of repeatability of the positive findings across different populations. For example, in the 2003 update of the Human Performance and Health-Related Fitness Gene Map, all the genes associated with body composition, plasma lipid, and hemostatic phenotype training responses were based on a single study .However, with hemodynamic phenotypes, some candidate gene findings have been replicated in at least two studies. For example, an association between blood pressure training response and the angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism has been reported in the HERITAGE Family Study and the DNASCO study . In white HERITAGE males, the angiotensinogen M235M homozygotes showed the greatest reduction in submaximal exercise diastolic blood pressure following a 20-week endurance training program . In middle-aged Eastern Finnish men, the M235M homozygotes had the most favorable changes in resting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure during a 6-year exercise intervention trial .Similarly, an association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and training-induced left ventricular growth has been reported in two studies . In 1997, Montgomery and coworkers reported that the ACE D-allele is associated with greater increases in left ventricular mass, and septal and posterior wall thickness after 10 weeks of physical training in British Army recruits . In 2001, the same group reported a new study using a similar training paradigm in British Army recruits . The cohort included 62 ACE I/I and 79 ACE D/D homozygotes, and the traininginduced increase in left ventricular mass was 2.7 times greater in the D/D genotype compared to the I/I homozygotes. Interestingly, the association between the ACE genotype and left ventricular mass response was not affected by angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibitor treatment .\n",

      "Data on the genotype-by-physical activity interactions on the risk of cancer are still scarce. However, the first study supporting the idea that physical activity may modify the outcome of breast cancer even among the women with verified genetic predisposition to the disease was published in 2003. King and coworkers investigated the risk of breast and ovarian cancer associated with the mutations in the BRCA7 and BRCA2 genes in Ashkenazi Jewish women . Although mutations in both genes significantly increase the risk of breast cancer, the results suggested that physical activity and body weight might modify the penetration of the disease.Mutation carriers who were physically active as teenagers were diagnosed with breast cancer significantly later in life than those who were sedentary. In the sedentary group, 60 and 95% of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer by the age of 45 and 55 years, respectively; the corresponding ages in the physically active women were 53 and 73 years . Similarly, women who were overweight at menarche and were heavier at age 21 had an earlier age of breast cancer onset among the carriers of BRCAI and BRCA2 mutations.\n",

The recent advances in molecular genetics are starting to have an impact on physical activity research and exercise physiology. Although the research on molecular genetics of physical performance and health-related fitness is still in its infancy, understanding the effects of DNA sequence variation on interindividual differences in responsiveness to acute exercise and regular physical activity holds great promise. Such data would ultimately help to utilize physical activity more efficiently in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.\n",

      "The association between overweight or obesity and breast cancer incidence has been an area of extensive epidemiological research, beginning with studies in the 1970s that demonstrated that heavier women were at increased risk of breast cancer . Such extensive research has been needed in part because the association of diverse measures of weight and body fat mass with breast cancer varies by a number of different characteristics of women. For example, the epidemiological evidence on weight or body mass index and breast cancer risk varies by menopausal status , age at diagnosis, hormone receptor status of the breast cancer, and exposure to exogenous estrogens. In addition, the associations observed vary by time period during the life cycle when weight or BMI is measured.This chapter will summarize the epidemiological evidence on overweight and obesity and breast cancer risk over three major periods in the life cycle: birth and early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The most informative studies have distinguished between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer; examined the effect of weight or BMI, weight gain, and central body fat; and examined the differential effects of exposure to endogenous and exogenous estrogens. With the recognition of the potential role of insulin-related peptides and possible interactions between these peptides and estrogen, recent studies have also begun to explore the potential interactions of insulin-related peptides with body size. Because studies of breast cancer have used so many different BMI cutpoints that are not consistent with current World Health Organization criteria of overweight and obesity, the term \"heavier women\" is used to describe the upper BMI groups rather than the terms \"overweight\" and \"obese.\"\n",

      "A limited number of studies have examined weight or BMI at birth, during childhood, and early in adulthood relative to breast cancer. The data on birth weight and breast cancer are limited by a very small number of cases; most studies have fewer than 100 cases. Some studies find no association or a nonsignificant increased risk ; others find an increase in risk with increasing birth weight for premenopausal but not postmenopausal breast cancer or a stronger increase in risk for premenopausal compared to postmenopausal breast cancer . One study that examined the association of measured birth weight with early onset premenopausal breast cancer found a significant relative risk of 1.25 for birth weights over 4000 g as well as a significant relative risk of 1.59 for low-birth weight of below 2500 g compared with birth weights in the middle range. Some studies have found an association between birth weight and adult BMI , suggesting that women with a high birth weight may also have a high adult BMI, which is also associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.\n",

      "The association of young adult weight, BMI, or other measures of relative weight adjusted for height has been examined in over 35 case-control studies and at least seven cohort studies and was well summarized in a review by Okasha et al. in 2003 . In most of these studies, weight and height are based on self-report during midlife in which women are asked to recall their weight and height at age 18 or 20, but have included self-report of weight and height at various ages from age 12 to 25. In most case-control studies, heavier weight or BMI during teenage and young adulthood is associated with a 10 to 30% decrease in breast cancer risk for pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.However, this decreased risk is most often not statistically significant . In one cohort study that examined changes in risk by 5-year intervals from age 30 to 69 for relative weight based on measured weight and height , the relative risk associated with BMI was less than 1 up to age 55 and gradually increased to 1.22 by ages 65 to 69. Few studies have measured heights and weights at younger ages and, with the exception of a study by Le Marchand et al. , most have limited numbers of breast cancer cases and therefore are difficult to interpret .\n",

      "Most studies find that heavier women have a decreased risk of premenopausal breast cancer . Other studies find no association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer . Relative risks of approximately 0.6 to 0.7 have been reported whether weight or BMI is assessed at the time of diagnosis or at earlier times during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood . Early studies suggested that the protective effect among heavier women was limited to early stage disease due to poorer detection of small tumors . However, subsequent studies in these same groups suggest that detection bias does not explain the increased risk for breast cancer observed among lean premenopausal women .A large case-control study of 1588 cases found that risk was increased about twofold among women who were tall and thin compared with women who were heavy and short . A metaanalysis of seven cohorts comprising 723 incident cases of invasive breast cancer in premenopausal women found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.54 for women with a BMI higher than 31 compared to women with a BMI less than 21 . This estimate is consistent with the reduction in risk of 0.6 to 0.7 observed in many studies and does not appear to be present for BMIs less than 28.Conversely, most studies have found that heavier women are at increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer . A meta-analysis of seven cohorts comprising 3208 cases of invasive postmenopausal breast cancer found gradual increases in risk to a BMI of 28 after which risk did not increase further; the relative risk for a BMI of 28 compared with a BMI of less than 21 was 1.26 . The majority of studies on BMI and breast cancer risk have adjusted for major breast cancer risk factors, including reproductive factors. Few studies have examined in detail the effect of confounding or interactions with diet and physical activity.Breast density has recently emerged as an important breast cancer risk factor. However, studies on obesity and breast cancer have not generally had information on breast density and thus have not examined the effect of any possible interactions between obesity and breast density. Only one study in Vermont that had data on breast density from screening mammograms has controlled for the effect of breast density . Because BMI is inversely related to breast density, adjustment for breast density resulted in an increase in the risk estimations at all levels of BMI; the odd ratio increased from 1.9 to 2.5 after adjustment for breast density among obese women.When examined, risk estimates for the association between obesity and breast cancer vary by age at diagnosis, history of hormone replacement therapy, estrogen receptor status of the tumor, and, possibly, family history of breast cancer. Risk has been found to increase with age at diagnosis in some studies that include a substantial number of postmenopausal women older than 65 years . In one study, risk estimates increased from 1.1 among women younger than 60 years to 1.8 among women older than 65 years .The effect of exogenous estrogen or estrogen receptor status of tumors has been examined with stratified analyses in more recent studies . In these studies, obesity-related risk has been higher among women who have never used hormone replacement therapy as shown in Table 14.2 . Huang et al. were the first to report this finding in a large cohort study in the U.S. They found a statistically significant BMI and estrogen replacement interaction, with no increase in risk among all women, but an increase in risk among heavier women who had not used HRT . The Women's Health Initiative cohort in the U.S., which had measured height and weight, found an even larger increase in risk among obese postmenopausal women who had never used HRT , but no increase in risk in similarly obese women who had ever used HRT .At least three studies have examined risk by BMI and estrogen receptor status of the breast tumor . In one U.S. study, risk for a BMI of 27 compared to a BMI of 22 was 2.4 for tumors that were estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive . In another study, risk estimates were 2.0 and 2.2 for a BMI of 30.7 compared to a BMI of 23 for estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone-positive tumors, respectively . In both of these studies, obesity-related risk was not increased for estrogen- and progesterone receptor-negative tumors. In one Japanese study, risk did not vary by estrogen or progesterone status of the tumor . However, the women in this study were lean; the upper quartile of BMI of 22 in this study is lower than the lowest quartile of BMI in most U.S. studies.Data are very limited on variation in BMI-related risk for postmenopausal breast cancer by family history. In several studies from the Iowa Women's Health Study, heavier postmenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer have a greater risk of developing breast cancer than do heavier women without a family history . In one study in Japan, no differences were observed in associations of weight, BMI, or change in BMI by family history for premenopausal breast cancer, although somewhat stronger associations were seen for weight and change in BMI and postmenopausal breast cancer among postmenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer; this confirmed earlier results by Sellers and colleagues . Only one study has examined variation in BMI-related risk for premenopausal breast cancer by family history of breast cancer . In that study, the inverse association commonly observed between BMI and breast cancer risk was only observed in women without a family history of breast cancer.\n",

      "Data on central adiposity and premenopausal breast cancer do not suggest a consistent association between measures, such as waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio, and breast cancer risk . Only five of these studies observed statistically significant increases in risk . Increases in central adiposity, assessed by waist circumference or the ratio of waist to hip circumference, have been associated with a 1.3- to 2.0-fold increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women in most studies . However, not all studies show this association .The association in postmenopausal women may be modified by a family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In the Iowa Women's Health Study, among women with elevated waist-to-hip ratio, only women with a positive family history of breast cancer were at increased risk. The combination of a high wasit-to-hip ratio with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer was associated with a more than fourfold increase in risk of breast cancer . Several studies have also reported on the association of hip circumference with breast cancer; most show no association among premenopausal women . Among postmenopausal women, variable increases in risk with increasing hip circumference have been found in some but not all studies. In the few studies that have examined risk stratified by HRT use, risk for increases in waist and hip circumference were increased among women who had never used HRT but were not increased among women who had ever used HRT .0.79 1.12 1.18 ור מיני 17 מיטורים 17 מיליון 17 מ 17 מיטורים (נו tam et al., 2000 U.S. riedenreich et 2002, Canada \n",

      "The most consistent body size predictor of postmenopausal breast cancer risk is adult weight gain . Findings from one of the largest cohort studies suggest that a doubling of risk occurred with a weight gain of more than 20 kg after the age of 18 years, but only among women who had never used postmenopausal HRT . Other studies have also observed similar results, with increases in risk limited to or much larger among women who have gained more weight and who have never used HRT compared to current users .Consistent with findings for BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, weight gain appears to be associated with a reduced or no significantly increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in most studies . However, a study by Wenten et al. in New Mexico found differences in risk for Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white women . In that study, no association was found between weight gain and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among non-Hispanic white women: in contrast, a nonstatistically significant but nearly twofold increased risk was observed with more than 14 kg of weight gain among Hispanic white women.The only study that has examined the effect of percent body fat measured by bioelectric impedance as well as several other measures of body size, fat mass, and distribution found the strongest association for percent body fat, with a doubling of risk for women with a percent body fat of over 36% compared to women with a percent body fat of less than 27%. Similar to results reported for BMI and weight gain, risk for percent body fat was stronger among women who had never used HRT. Among women with a percent body fat of more than 36%, the risk estimate among women who did not use HRT was 3.4 compared to 1.0 among women using HRT .\n",

      "The majority of research on the association of obesity with breast cancer incidence has been based on white populations from Europe, Canada, and the U.S. A limited number of studies in other racial or ethnic groups suggest there may be some differences in observed associations among Hispanic and African American women; observed associations in Asian populations have been similar to those among white women. Among the major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., African American women have the highest prevalence of obesity. Several studies have estimated that the high rates of severe obesity may account for some of the later stage at diagnosis observed for African American women in comparison to white women . However, few studies have examined the association of BMI or regional adiposity with breast cancer in African American women.In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, similar patterns of an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer were observed for African American and white women. In contrast to other studies, BMI was not associated with an increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer in African American or white women. Curiously, an increased waist-to-hip ratio, a measure of central adiposity, was associated with an increased risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer, although the increased risk estimates were only statistically significant among premenopausal women. A small case-control study in Nigeria found an increased risk for breast cancer for women with a BMI of 30 or more; however, the risk estimate was not statistically significant due to small numbers .National data also indicate that Hispanic women in the U.S. have higher rates of obesity. Studies on the association of BMI and other measures of obesity and breast cancer incidence among Hispanic women are very limited. One study in New Mexico that included Hispanic white and non-Hispanic white women found that usual BMI and weight change during adult life increased risk for premenopausal as well as postmenopausal breast cancer among both groups of women. However, none of the relative risk estimates in this analysis stratified by menopausal status and ethnicity were statistically significant because of limited sample size. One small study in Brazil found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer and a positive association between BMI and postmenopausal breast cancer.Larger studies are needed in these populations in the U.S. to better define how obesity in these populations is associated with breast cancer. In contrast, a number of studies among Asian populations in the U.S., Japan, and China have found similar associations between obesity and breast cancer risk as those observed among white populations.\n",

      "As summarized by Bernstein and Patel in Chapter 4 of this book and in other recent reviews , the evidence that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer is increasing. A limited number of studies on physical activity and breast cancer risk have had sufficient numbers of cases to examine the effect of physical activity stratified by BMI. Several of these studies have found a greater reduction in risk with being physically active among women who were in the lower range of BMI.Unfortunately, studies of obesity and breast cancer risk have rarely reported on the association of BMI stratified by physical activity. One exception is a study by Enger et al. that examined the interaction of BMI and physical activity for ER+/PR+ tumors; these researchers did not find statistically significant interaction but did observe the greatest reductions in risk among women with low BMI . More work is needed among large studies with good measures of physical activity and BMI before conclusions can be reached on whether the effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk is different among lean as compared to overweight and obese women.\n",

      "In the area of breast cancer incidence, research on the association of weight, BMI, and other measures of fat distribution and weight change during middle and older adult life has been extensive. New research on these measures in this time of life should focus on exploring underlying mechanisms by which these exposures may influence cancer risk. Although recent research has examined differences in association by exogenous estrogen exposure, few studies have examined whether risk associated with obesity and other measures varies by characteristics of the tumor, such as hormone receptor status . As basic and clinical research identifies additional specific tumor markers that may influence disease progression, it will be important to design studies to examine the effect of BMI, weight gain, and measures of fat distribution on the relative proportion of tumors that express these markers.In addition, the interactions among diet, physical activity, and weight and breast cancer risk have been minimally explored. Such studies require very large samples with good measures of all of these exposures to have the power to identify differential effects in population subgroups. Although adult weight gain from young adult to middle life has been a consistent risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, research is needed on the effect of changes in weight during different periods in time when the breast may be undergoing rapid change, such as during puberty and pregnancy . Only a limited number of studies have attempted to examine this issue and these have not had repeat measures of weight across all of these time periods or have had to rely on recall in weight from the distant past.A recent study from the Framingham cohort that examined weight change based on repeat measured weights, found an increased risk only with weight gain from age 25 through middle age,FIGURE 14.1 Summary of past and future research directions exploring the associations of body size and breast cancer risk across the life cycle.but not for weight gain in the young adult period or in the later postmenopausal period. However, given the missing information about weight at younger ages, this study did not have the power to explore the effect of weight gain during puberty and pregnancy fully.In order to examine the contribution of estrogen as the underlying mechanism by which obesity influences breast cancer risk, studies have examined the risk of obesity or weight gain in groups stratified by HRT or estrogen status of the tumor. However, few studies have examined whether the effect of insulin-related peptides vary by BMI. Research is beginning to be published on the role of metabolic syndrome and breast cancer incidence . Similarly, a limited number of studies have begun to explore the effect of high glycemic load or glycemic index and cancer risk for other cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. Some evidence suggests that these dietary patterns are more likely to lead to abnormalities in glucose metabolism and insulin processing among obese as compared to normal weight individuals. Therefore, research should be designed to examine whether such differential effects occur for breast cancer outcomes in normal as compared to overweight women.Research is beginning to explore whether measures postulated to relate to immune function, such as C-reactive protein, may be adversely affected in obesity and therefore be another mechanism by which obesity increases disease risk. In addition, the identification of biologically active cytokines produced by adipose tissue, such as leptin and adiponectin, is beginning to be examined for a possible role in breast cancer. For example, two small case-control studies have found that low serum adiponectin levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, possibly through a nonestrogen-mediated mechanism . At present, studies examining the role of cytokines and other inflammatory markers are very limited in breast cancer. However, such measures may be available in many large cohort and case-control studies and may be a promising area of exploration in the future.Finally, most of the obesity-related research in breast cancer has been done based on general risk populations of white women. Future research is needed to examine how BMI, weight gain, and measures of regional adiposity influence risk for breast cancer among women from different racial and ethnic groups, as well as women at increased risk of cancer as assessed by family history or specific molecular markers of genetic susceptibility. One study has reported that, among women with inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, women who were normal weight and physically active in adolescence had a delayed onset of breast cancer .\n",

      "Extensive data from case-control and cohort studies provide convincing evidence of a modest 30% increased risk of postmenopausal breast cell cancer from overweight and obesity and a larger twofold increase in risk for adult weight gain. Estimates from a meta-analysis of cohort studies found gradual increases in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer to a BMI of 28, after which risk did not increase further. The relative risk for a BMI of 28 compared with a BMI of less than 21 was 1.26 . However, risk estimates vary by age at diagnosis, history of HRT, and estrogen receptor status of the tumor with a much stronger risk observed among overweight and obese women who have never used HRT or who have estrogen-positive tumors.Another meta-analysis found that this increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer corresponded to a 12% increase for an overweight woman and a 25% increase for an obese woman . A stronger association is seen for adult weight gain, with a doubling of risk among women who have never used HRT and who gained over 20 kg from age 18 . A meta-analysis of cohort studies found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.54 for women with a BMI higher than 31 compared to women with a BMI of less than 21 . This estimate is consistent with the reduction in risk of 0.6 to 0.7 observed in many studies and does not appear to be present for BMIs less than 28. Data on the association of various measures of regional adiposity, such as waist or hip circumference, are limited and less consistent, with few finding associations among premenopausal women and some showing increases in risk among postmenopausal women with increased waist or hip circumferences.Given the strength of the evidence from observational epidemiological studies on the role of obesity in postmenopausal breast cancer risk, a logical next question to be examined is the effect of weight loss in reducing risk. Few observational epidemiological studies have examined the effect of weight loss on disease risk because of the inability to distinguish intended from unintended weight loss related to coexisting disease. Because of this potential bias, reports of the association of weight loss with breast cancer outcomes from observational epidemiological studies must be interpreted with caution and few studies have examined this issue. In fact, most studies have included women with weight loss in the reference group when examining the association of changes in weight or BMI with breast cancer risk.The limited number of studies that have examined the association of weight loss separately have not found statistically significant associations between weight loss and risk . Only one study has examined the effect of intentional weight loss on breast cancer risk. In that study from the Iowa's Women's Health Study, intentional weight loss of 20 or more pounds was associated with a 21% reduction in risk of subsequent postmenopausal breast cancer . After adjustment for multiple other breast cancer risk factors, this reduced risk was essentially unchanged . This study also found a reduction in risk among women who had lost at least 10 lb from their maximum weight .Research has begun to explore the effect of randomized controlled trials of weight loss and specific diet and physical activity changes on physiological factors that may influence breast cancer risk, such as estrogen, androgens, and insulin-related peptides. Evidence from these studies is summarized in Chapter 7 in this book. Conclusive evidence of the effect of weight loss on breast cancer risk will require randomized controlled trials of weight loss involving changes in diet and physical activity.Only a few studies have attempted to estimate the population-attributable risk or what proportion of postmenopausal breast cancer can be attributed to overweight and obesity. In 2001, Bergstrom et al. estimated that about 9% of postmenopausal breast cancer could be attributed to overweight and obesity . However, that estimate was based on rates of overweight and obesity in European countries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Current rates of overweight and obesity among women in the U.S. are much higher. For example, the rate of obesity among women in Europe in the Bergstrom study was 13%, but the rate of obesity among women in the U.S. today is about 33%. Therefore, a rough estimate of the population-attributable fraction of breast cancer due to overweight and obesity today in the U.S. may be closer to 15%. Given evidence of a continued increase in obesity in the U.S. and internationally, it is likely that obesity will become an increasingly important contributor to breast cancer risk worldwide.\n",

      "Many aspects of the associations among body weight, obesity, and colorectal cancer have been examined. Colorectal cancer has been studied looking at the combined colon and rectal areas, as well as each site separately. Additionally, unlike many cancers, associations between body size and the precursor lesion, adenomous polyps, have been reported. Weight and height data using body mass index , fat patterning using waist and hip circumference measurements, and weight change are indicators of body size that provide insight into the association and possible biological mechanisms underlying the association.The literature is consistent in terms of reported associations between body size and colon and rectal cancers. Gender-specific associations have been observed almost universally, with stronger associations reported for men than for women . Site-specific associations that have been reported suggest that obesity is associated mainly with colon cancer rather than rectal cancer, although studies that have examined proximal and distal colon cancers report stronger associations for distal rather than proximal tumors.Most epidemiological studies examining the association with body weight and obesity have relied on self-reported height and weight. For case-control studies, the period of recalled height and weight varies from several years prior to diagnosis to the year prior to diagnosis; cohort studies usually use self-reported current height and weight, with varying individual time between reported data and cancer diagnosis. Height and weight measurements are converted to indicators of body mass, with BMI the most commonly used. Sometimes the World Health Organization criteria for overweight and obesity are used.Unfortunately, most studies currently in the literature have not used WHO standards for determining obesity, thus making comparisons and interpretations across studies more difficult. Rather, most studies have categorized BMI based on distribution in the studied population. The upper range of BMI for many studies is close to the ≥30 set by WHO; however, sometimes the upper range isat 26, which would indicate overweight but not obesity by the WHO criteria. Limited data exist on waist or hip circumference measurements as indicators of fat pattern and its impact on colorectal cancer risk. Few studies have evaluated BMI and circumference measures simultaneously to determine the independent effects of each. Also, limited information is available on weight change or early life body size as possible risk factors for colon and rectal cancer.\n",

      "Reported associations between body size and colon cancer have been fairly consistent across casecontrol and cohort studies. Studies of cases of 100 or more cases are shown in Table 15.1. Other studies with fewer cases provide similar estimates of association, although with less precision. Studies that have examined associations with obesity report slightly stronger associations than those that report associations for overweight or a BMI of over 25. For men, most studies report significantly increased risk, with relative risk estimates of around 2.0. although estimates range from 1.2 to 3.0. Most studies have adjusted for important confounding factors, including physical activity, dietary intake, and smoking; however, some report only ageadjusted estimates of association . Most studies show evidence of a dose-response association.Among women, associations are generally weaker than those observed for men and are often not statistically significant; point estimates are often around 1.4 and range from 0.7 to 2.7 . Some variation in risk estimates among women may stem from ages of the women studied because stronger associations have been observed for pre- vs. postmenopausal women overall and postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy are at higher risk if they are overweight or obese than if they are normal weight .The association between body size and risk of colon cancer in African Americans is not well documented: only one study of 99 cases evaluated the association between BMI and colorectal cancer , with imprecise estimates of association. The cohort study by Chyou and colleagues showed only a weak association between BMI and colorectal cancer risk among Asian men living in Hawaii. It is unknown whether this weaker association is from the lower levels of BMI observed in that population or whether the lack of association is the result of some other unknown factors. Data on associations between body size and colon cancer among other racial and ethnic groups are limited.Some studies that have been adequately powered to look at associations for proximal and distal colon tumors show stronger associations for distal tumors than proximal tumors , although the study by Le Marchand et al. showed stronger associations with proximal rather than distal tumors. The study by Terry did not observe a significant association for proximal or distal tumors; however, the study population was restricted to women and, given the weaker associations usually detected for women, this is not inconsistent with the literature. In a study by Le Marchand et al. the greatest risk associated with a large BMI was observed for sigmoid tumors, which most studies include as part of the distal colon. Although most studies report associations between body size and incident cancers, Murphy et al. report associations for mortality similar to those reported for incidence.The association between colorectal neoplasia and body fat distribution, as indicated by the waist-to-hip ratio, is shown in Table 15.1 as the set of relative risks or odds ratios with high vs. low or normal levels of waist-to-hip ratio . Results from case-control as well as cohort studies suggest that a higher waist-hip ratio increases risk of colon cancer. The ranges and distributions of this ratio differ substantially across the various studies; however, as was observed with BMI, the waist-to-hip ratio also shows a pattern of a positive association with increased colon cancer risk. In the studies displaying a dose-response pattern, no specific threshold for this association was found except in the study of males by Giovannucci et al. .A study conducted by MacInnis and colleagues evaluated several indicators of body size and body composition in coniunction with colon cancer risk.

The associations with BMI and fat mass were attenuated when adjusted for other factors. However, the association with fat-free mass and waist-hip ratio remained after adjustment for other body composition measures. The authors proposed two independent effects of body composition on risk of colon cancer: one associated with nonadipose mass and the other with central adiposity.Few studies have examined weight change and colon cancer risk. However, some studies have reported on BMI and obesity at different times in life. In general, no evidence suggests a stronger association between BMI earlier in life and colorectal neoplasia than one later in life. The cohort studies by Lee et al. and Le Marchand et al. show relative risks for BMI in the late second and the third decades of life similar to those for BMIs in later adulthood . Case-control studies suggest that elevated BMI in the later adult years and weight gain between early adult ages and later adult ages tends to increase risk for colon cancer .\n",

      "Few studies have examined associations between body size and rectal cancer and those that have generally reported results for few cases. From existing data, it appears that body size is not associated with rectal cancer among men or women . The study by Slattery et al. is the largest study of rectal cancer reported to date. In that study of almost 1000 rectal cancer cases, no difference was found in risk of rectal cancer associated with being overweight or obese . Other components of energy balance, energy intake and energy expenditure, were associated in a similar manner as was observed for colon cancer using the same study population and methods to collect data . This implies that increased BMI and a positive energy balance may be less important risk factors for rectal cancer than for colon cancer. Studies that have combined colon and rectal tumors generally observe weaker associations than those that report associations for colon tumors only.\n",

      "Studies of adenomas are important to provide evidence for the time in colorectal carcinogenesis when factors associated with body weight might be most important in colorectal cancer. Studies evaluating the association between body size and adenoma occurrence have examined associations by polyp size and type. Most studies have examined BMI with associations similar to those observed for colon cancer . Some studies do not detect associations with adenomas and body size . In a study that included cancer and adenomas, an increased risk with a large BMI was observed for large adenomas only, but not for colorectal tumors .Most studies have observed a 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in risk of adenomas among the group with the largest BMI. A large waist-to-hip ratio also has been associated with risk for adenomas, with stronger associations observed for larger adenomas . The observation that BMI is more strongly associated with larger adenomas than with smaller ones suggests that obesity-related factors might be acting at a later stage in the development of cancer - perhaps by contributing to the promotion and progression of adenomas toward cancer. Alternatively, this pattern could be seen simply because there may be many other causes of small adenomas that do not progress; among people with small adenomas, those other causes serve to dilute-out the obesity association with risk.\n",

      "Evaluation of risk associated with body size in conjunction with other factors can provide insight into possible biological mechanisms. The factors most frequently evaluated with body size have included other components of energy balance, including physical activity and energy intake. Hormone replacement therapy, estrogen status, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also have been evaluated in conjunction with BMI ; Table 15.2 summarizes data from one large case-control study . Given numbers of cases and controls available from that study, evaluation of interaction is possible. High levels of vigorous physical activity and low levels of energy intake have been shown to modify the colon cancer risk associated with obesity in several studies . Studies further suggest that diet composition, specifically diets with a high glycemic index, may be important effect modifiers . Hypothesis related to the assessment of these interactions stems from the energy balance equation that illustrates the relationship among energy intake, energy expenditure, and ability to maintain energy balance.The hypothesis for assessing interactions between menopausal hormone use and estrogen developed from the observed gender-specific associations identified for BMI and colon cancer. Studies that have evaluated the interactions between obesity and estrogen or menopausal hormone use have shown that being overweight or obese increases risk of colon cancer only among women who are estrogen positive . As shown in Figure 15.1, among these women, risks associated with a large BMI are similar to associations observed in men, with risk estimates twice that of those for women who are lean. However, women who are estrogen negative do not experience the same effect from being overweight or obese.Further delineation between postmenopausal women who take and do not take menopausal hormones results in a risk for women not taking menopausal hormones that is not different from the referent; those who do take menopausal hormones have risk at the level of or slightly higher than that observed for men. In men it has been observed that, with advancing age, risk associated with being overweight or obese declines . This could be the result of declining androgen levels that operate in a similar fashion to that of estrogen in regulating cancer risk associated with obesity because they have a similar influence as that of estrogen on insulin resistance .

      "Notes: E = exposure; PAL = physical activity level. High exposure is defined as high energy intake, low energy expenditure, not using estrogen , not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Thus, high E/low BMI reflects risk of exposure other than BMI, low E/high BMI reflects risk from high BMI ; high E and high BMI is the relative risk from having the exposure and from having a high BMI.between physical activity and BMI and estrogen and BMI suggests that BMI may influence colorectal risk through its influence on insulin.Of interest also is the observed significant interaction between use of NSAIDs and BMI . It is unclear whether this interaction indicates a mechanism involving inflammation or some other complex mechanism at play.\n",

      "Evaluation of the association between BMI and colon cancer looking at specific tumor mutations has provided insight into possible mechanisms of action and the role of body size in what may be specific disease pathways. Few studies have been reported to date, although those that have suggest that BMI may be involved in several pathways. One study reported that a large BMI was associated with Ki-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 . The BMI associations appeared to be more specific for Ki-ras mutations in women than in men. BMI appeared to be associated equally with tumors with and without p53 mutations . Obesity was reported as associated only with tumors that were stable in women; however, in men, obesity was associated with stable as well as unstable tumors .\n",

      "It has been proposed that the influence of energy balance on risk of colon cancer may embrace endogenous hormone metabolism . The mechanisms that relate obesity to risk of colon cancer most likely include a complex metabolic pathway involving estrogen, insulin, and inflammation.Perhaps the mechanism that may have the greatest effect on the association between BMI and colon cancer involves the insulin pathway and the cross-talk between insulin and estrogen/androgen. Support for this association comes from data looking at BMI risk by exposure to estrogen and menopausal hormone use as previously described. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by the different in risk observed for men and women and the interaction with physical activity. High levels of BMI are associated with high levels of insulin; on the other hand, adipose tissue stores estrogen that may be turned on in a low-estrogen environment, such as that seen in postmenopausal women. However, if the findings by MacInnis et al. are repeated in other studies, and the fatfree mass and central adiposity are more important than BMI, it is possible that the BMI-associated colon cancer risk is operating through high insulin levels. Because studies support a significant interaction between BMI and estrogen, it is possible that insulin and estrogen pathways are both operational.Insulin-related genes may interact with BMI to alter risk of colorectal cancer. Insulin-like growth factor-1 , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 , insulin receptor substrate-1 , and insulin receptor substrate-2 have been proposed as involved in insulin-related pathways of cancer etiology. Polymorphisms of these genes have been identified, some of which have been shown to have effects on insulin resistance and/or diabetes. High serum IGF-1 levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and variation in serum IGF-1 levels has been associated with a 19 CA repeat polymorphism 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site . In men, serum IGF-1 concentrations were lower with the 19CA genotype than for other IGF1 genotypes . One could predict that this genotype might be associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.High levels of IGFBP-3 have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer . An A/C polymorphism at nucleotide -202 is associated with different levels of IGFBP-3 in a dose-response fashion, i.e., AA > AC > CC . A Gly972Arg polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene has been associated with insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes . The G1057D IRS-2 polymorphism has been associated with obesity and therefore a plausible link to insulin resistance and colorectal cancer . Studies also have suggested that IRS-2 is involved in insulin signaling and in the regulation of obesity . One study evaluating the association between these genotypes and colon and rectal cancer risk observed a significant interaction between BMI and IRS-2 and risk of rectal cancer and a borderline significant association with colon cancer . For colon cancer, those with the DD genotype had the greatest risk if they also had a BMI of 30 or more. Those with the DD IRS-2 genotype were half as likely to develop rectal cancer at a BMI of <25 than those with the GG genotype.Some studies suggest that the vitamin D receptor also may be involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-mediated disease pathways. The VDR4 is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation and metabolic homeostasis . Polymorphisms of the VDR gene most frequently studied include two restriction fragment length polymorphisms in intron 8 and one in exon 9 . These are in linkage disequilibrium with each other and with several 3' untranslated region polymorphisms, including a poly A repeat .At the start site of the gene, a polymorphism detected with a Fok I digest also has been studied and has been shown not to be in linkage disequilibrium with the other variants . The polymorphism associated with lack of Fok1 digestion changes the start site from the first STG to one that is three codons downstream; thus the F genotype is associated with a protein three amino acids shorter than that associated with the f genotype. VDR polymorphisms have been examined in conjunction with colorectal adenomas and cancer and SS and BB variants have been shown to reduce adenoma/cancer risk .The ff genotype of the Fok I polymorphism has been reported in one study to increase risk of colorectal cancer . VDR genotypes, BMI, physical activity, and energy intake have been evaluated with energy balance and risk of colorectal cancer in one study . Data from a population-based case control study of colon and rectal cancers was used to evaluate the associations. The Bsm1, polyA, and Fokl VDR polymorphisms were evaluated. For colon cancer, those who were obese were at greater risk of colon cancer if they had the SS or BB or ff VDR genotypes. These findings are unexpected because the SS, BB, and ff alleles reduce risk of colon cancer overall.Inflammation as a mechanisms related to obesity is being explored, although it is far from understood. Aspirin and other NSAIDs have been recognized as reducing risk of colorectal cancer for many years . Although involvement in the COX-2 pathway has been thought to be the main biological mechanism underlying this association, it is possible that aspirin and NSAIDS may be involved in other biological mechanism. Cyclooxygenase-independent actions have been proposed, stimulated in part by the observations that NSAIDS inhibit tumor formation and growth in COX-deficient cell lines .It has been proposed that aspirin and other NSAIDs reduce inflammation and that a reduction in inflammation decreases insulin resistance . High doses of salicylates have been shown to reverse hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rodents by sensitizing insulin signaling. In patients with type-2 diabetes, aspirin treatment has been shown to reduce fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and insulin clearance; aspirin reduced hepatic glucose production and improved insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake by 20% . Aspirin/NSAID influence on insulin resistance appears to be independent of COX-2 inhibition; instead, it involves inhibition of NFKB and IKB and/or activation of PPARs. An interaction between aspirin and IRS-1 in antagonizing effects of tumor necrosis factor-α has also been reported TNF-α is a major cause of insulin resistance associated with obesity and inflammation.As with all mechanisms reviewed, it is possible that obesity is in the causal pathway associated with mechanisms involving estrogen/androgen, insulin, and inflammation rather than the cause. However, studies that have examined BMI after adjusting for NSAIDs and aspirin continue to see direct associations between BMI and risk of colon cancer. To better understand the mechanisms involved in the obesity/body composition relationship with colon cancer, it is necessary to consider obesity and body composition alone. Research directed at understanding the components of energy balance and how they are mediated by factors such as estrogen and aspirin are needed.\n",

      "Failure to achieve energy balance is gaining momentum as an important consideration in the etiology of cancer. The concept of energy balance, or the ability to maintain body weight by balancing energy intake with energy expenditure, ties together important colon cancer risk factors, Elevated levels of body fat, as indicated by increased BMI during adult life and/or increased waist-to-hip ratio, are associated with increased risk for colon cancer and colon adenomas.This association is seen for men and women, though it is higher for men. The reason for this difference by gender is not clear, although some data suggest that estrogen/androgen and aspirin/NSAIDs are involved in these differences. If obesity is simply an indicator of caloric imbalance then there should be no difference between the genders. On the other hand, obesity may have an offsetting beneficial effect among women. A factor such as the hyperestrogenemia associated with postmenopausal obesity could explain the gender differences — an estrogen benefit could be serving to blunt the obesity-related risk in women.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer is very much a disease of affluence, with age-standardized incidence rates that are up to ten times higher in Western, industrialized countries than in rural Asia or Africa . Studies on time trends, as well as on migrants from low- to high-risk areas, have clearly shown that nongenetic factors are to be held responsible for the large international differences in incidence rates.One of the key risk factors for endometrial cancer among pre- and postmenopausal women is excess body weight . In many studies, endometrial cancer risk was found to rise approximately linearly with increasing body mass index , especially among postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, several studies have shown a threshold effect, with an increase in risk only among obese women with a BMI of about 30 kg/m² or higher . Overall, excess body weight has been estimated to account for up to about half of endometrial cancer incidence in Western Europe and the U.S. .The endometrial tissue consists of stroma, vascular endothelium, and glandular and surface epithelium. These various cell types respond to sex steroids and other hormones in the circulation and also secrete a variety of growth factors that act as paracrine and autocrine regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Inhibition of cellular differentiation and apoptosis, and stimulation of cell proliferation, enhance tumor development by favoring the accumulation and fixation of mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, by stimulating the clonal expansion of cells with mutations and by enhancing the growth of established tumors .From a histological and molecular pathology perspective, the vast majority of endometrial tumors are endometrioid carcinomas, which are generally associated with endometrial hyperplasia . These carcinomas often show mutations in the ras protooncogene and in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, but not in the P53 tumor suppressor gene. Other tumors are more often serous papillary, clear cell, or squamous carcinomas; these generallydevelop from atrophic endometrial tissue in older women and often show P53 mutations, but not ras or PTEN mutations. Most epidemiological studies did not distinguish between these two tumor types. Nevertheless, some evidence indicates that endocrine and nutritional lifestyle factors, including obesity, affect the risk of type-I but not type-II tumors .Excess body weight is associated with a number of major changes in endocrine metabolism. Increasing evidence suggests that these endocrine changes - chronic hyperinsulinemia, decreased serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin , and increased levels of total and bioavailable androgens and estrogens - may provide the metabolic link between excess body weight and endometrial cancer development. In the present chapter, the relationships among excess weight, endogenous sex hormones, and endometrial cancer risk are discussed.\n",

      "The predominant theory describing the relationship between endogenous steroid hormones and endometrial cancer risk is known as the unopposed estrogen theory . This stipulates that endometrial cancer risk is increased in women who have high plasma bioavailable estrogens and/or low plasma progesterone so that mitogenic or proapoptotic effects of estrogens are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone.A first observation upon which the unopposed estrogen theory was based is that endometrial proliferation rates are increased during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone levels are low and estradiol levels are at normal premenopausal concentrations . More recent studies showed that, to a large part, the proliferative action of estradiol on endometrial tissue is mediated by an increased local production of insulin-like growth factor-I . The antiproliferative action of progesterone, on the other hand, has been shown to be largely mediated by enhanced local synthesis of IGF-binding protein-1, which is the most abundant IGF-binding protein in endometrial tissue and inhibits IGF-I action .A second major observation that led to the unopposed estrogen theory was that endometrial cancer risk is increased among women using exogenous estrogens, but no such increase occurs when the estrogens are combined with progestins. Studies in the 1970s showed an increase in endometrial cancer risk among users of sequential oral contraceptives containing a long-duration. relatively potent estrogen and a short-duration weak progestin . By contrast, the use of combined oral contraceptives that contain progestins for at least 10 days per monthly cycle has been associated with no increase or only a moderate increase in endometrial cancer risk.Among postmenopausal women, use of estrogen-only replacement therapy has been shown to increase endometrial cancer risk. No such increase has been found for women who used estrogen-progestin replacement therapy to which progestins were added sequentially for at least 10 days in a 1-month cycle (sequential estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy or continuously (combined estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy .In addition to these observations, increasing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that elevated postmenopausal levels of endogenous estrogens and reduced premenopausal levels of progesterone are risk factors for endometrial cancer .\n",

      "Relationships of endometrial cancer risk with blood levels of endogenous estrogens have been examined in a number of case-control studies and in two prospective cohort studies.Among postmenopausal women, several case-control studies have shown decreased plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin , as well as increased total and bioavailable estrogens, in endometrial cancer patients compared to cancer-free control subjects. Similar observations were made in one prospective cohort study in New York and in a subsequent extension of this study that combined a total of 124 cases and 236 controls from three prospective cohorts in New York, Northern Sweden, and Milan. In the extended study, endometrial cancer risk increased approximately sixfold for postmenopausal women in the top quintile of bioavailable estradiol compared to those in the bottom quintile .Among premenopausal women, one large case-control study showed decreased total and bioavailable estradiol in endometrial cancer patients, although they also had lower levels of SHBG and higher levels of estrone . Contrary to the observations made in postmenopausal women, the lack of direct association of premenopausal serum estradiol levels with endometrial cancer risk has been tentatively explained by the possible existence of a nonlinear relationship of estrogen levels with endometrial cancer. According to the latter hypothesis, endometrial cancer risk would be directly related to serum estradiol levels only within the postmenopausal range of 5 to 20 pg/ml, whereas there would be no such relationship within the premenopausal range .Excess weight results in increased estrogen concentrations from peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue by aromatase enzyme . After menopause, when ovarian production of estrogens stops, peripheral conversions in adipose tissue of Δ4-androstenedione to estrone and of estrone and testosterone into estradiol become the primary source of endogenous estradiol . Thus, in postmenopausal women, degree of adiposity appears to be linearly related to plasma levels of estrone and estradiol, as well as to levels of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG .In premenopausal women, contrary to postmenopausal women, excess weight and chronic hyperinsulinemia have little effect on levels of total or bioavailable estradiol . This is due to the relatively minor contribution of estrogen production by adipose tissue compared to the ovarian estrogen production, plus the fact that, in premenopausal women, total and bioavailable estrogen levels are also regulated through negative feedback of estradiol on the pituitary secretion of folliclestimulating hormone.\n",

      "Several case-control studies have shown that endometrial cancer risk is also increased in pre- and postmenopausal women with elevated plasma levels of Δ4-androstenedione and testosterone . Elevated circulating androgens have also been associated with hyperplasia of the endometrium, which generally precedes and accompanies the occurrence of type-I endometrial carcinomas . In addition to these observations, there is clear evidence for an increase in endometrial cancer risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome - a complex metabolic syndrome of ovarian hyperandrogenism characterized by elevated plasma levels of testosterone and Δ4-androstenedione and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea .Due to chronic anovulation and thus the lack of ovarian corpus luteum formation, this syndrome is also related to a deficit of ovarian progesterone production and low plasma progesterone levels. Cases of polycystic ovary syndrome in women developing endometrial cancer have been frequently reported, especially in young patients below the age of 40 . Furthermore, several casecontrol and cohort studies have shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer among women who have polycystic ovary syndrome or among infertile women who were clinically characterized by normal plasma estrogen levels but a deficiency of progesterone, with relative risk estimates between about 3.0 to 9.0 . Prevalence estimates of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome in premenopausal women vary between 3 and 8%, ranking it among the most common female endocrinedisorders . On the basis of these prevalence figures and of estimated average fivefold increase in endometrial cancer risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, this syndrome can account for about 24% of endometrial cancer cases among young, premenopausal women.Although endometrial tissue contains androgen receptors , androgens do not appear to have any direct stimulatory effect on endometrial cell proliferation; in fact, it is possible that they may even reduce proliferation rates . The association of plasma androgen levels with endometrial cancer risk is thus more likely to be explained by an increase in estrogens, especially in postmenopausal women, for whom plasma androgen levels are a key determinant of the amounts of estrogens formed in the endometrium and adipose tissue. In premenopausal women, ovarian androgen excess most likely increases endometrial cancer risk through reductions in ovarian progesterone production.Excess body weight generally has not been found to be strongly related to plasma levels of Δ4-andorstenedione and testosterone in postmenopausal women or in normoandrogenic premenopausal women , although obesity-induced lowering of SHBG concentrations does result in increased levels of bioavailable T, unbound to SHBG . In premenopausal women with ovarian hyperandrogenism polycystic ovary syndrome, however, excess weight and chronic hyperinsulinemia are related to increased absolute serum androgen concentrations .\n",

      "One major metabolic consequence of excess body weight is insulin resistance, which in turn leads to chronically elevated fasting and nonfasting plasma insulin levels . Several studies have shown that chronically elevated blood insulin concentrations can be a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk is increased in pre- and postmenopausal women with non-insulindependent diabetes - a condition generally associated with long periods of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia before as well as after its diagnosis.Furthermore, the results from at least two epidemiological studies in postmenopausal women suggest an increased risk with hyperinsulinemia, even in nondiabetic subjects. One large casecontrol study showed endometrial cancer risk to be associated with serum levels of C-peptide, a marker of pancreatic insulin secretion . A pooled, nested case-control study in cohorts in New York, Northern Sweden, and Milan showed a more than fivefold increase in endometrial cancer risk for women in the highest vs. the lowest quintile of plasma C-peptide . This strong relationship persisted after adjustment for BMI.Several mechanisms could explain the direct relationship of chronically elevated insulin with increased endometrial cancer risk. First, experiments in vitro have shown that insulin is a key regulator of IGFBP-1 gene expression and production in endometrial tissue ; thus, it seems likely that elevated insulin could increase IGF-I activity in endometrial tissue by downregulating endometrial IGFBP-1 levels . Second, insulin is a key regulator of the hepatic synthesis and plasma levels of SHBG, downregulating SHBG levels, and is thus a direct determinant of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG, especially among postmenopausal women . Finally, studies in vitro have shown stimulatory effects of insulin on androgen synthesis by ovarian tissue ; in women with polycystic ovary syndrome , hyperinsulinemia has been shown to be a major cause of ovarian androgen excess .Close to half the women with clinical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome are severely overweight or obese. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are present in lean and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome , but are more severe in the obese subgroup . Furthermore, most studies with polycystic ovary syndrome patients have showndirect associations of obesity or plasma insulin with levels of total plasma testosterone and Δ4androstenedione , and anovulatory cycles are also more frequent in the obese and more insulin-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome patients . In many women with polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin-lowering drugs can be used successfully to reduce ovarian androgen excess and restore regular menstrual cycles . These various observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia may be a direct cause of chronic anovulation and progesterone deficiency.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer is very much a disease of the economically developed world. Epidemiological studies have shown that the high incidence rates in high-risk countries are to be attributed to lifestyle factors. One major lifestyle factor associated with increased endometrial cancer risk is excess body weight, and this association is most likely due to adiposity-induced alterations in endogenous hormone metabolism.Epidemiological studies have shown increased endometrial cancer risks among pre- and postmenopausal women who have elevated plasma androstenedione and testosterone, as well as among postmenopausal women who have increased levels of estrone and estradiol. Furthermore, evidence is strong that chronic hyperinsulinemia is also an important risk factor. These various relationships of endometrial cancer risk with endocrine metabolism can all be interpreted in the light of the \"unopposed estrogen\" hypothesis, which proposes that endometrial cancer may develop as a result of the mitogenic effects of estrogens when these are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone. In premenopausal women, excess weight may increase risk by inducing hyperinsulinemia, ovarian hyperandrogenism , chronic anovulation, and progesterone deficiency. Among postmenopausal women, excess weight most likely continues stimulating endometrial cancer development by increasing bioavailable estrogen levels through the aromatization of the androgens in adipose tissue and the reduction of serum levels of SHBG.\n",

      "Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in Europe . Most patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed late in the progression of the disease and have a life expectancy of several months. In Europe and in the U.S., the 1-year and 5-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer are less than 25 and 5%, respectively, and mortality rates are essentially identical to incidence rates . Survival rates have only improved slightly over the past decade due to the lack of significant medical advancements in the early detection or treatment of pancreatic cancer. The majority of pancreatic cancers are exocrine adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Islet tumors of the endocrine pancreas and other types of exocrine tumors are very rare.Pancreatic cancer is rare in the first three decades of life. After age 30, however, incidence rates increase exponentially and peak in the seventh and eighth decades . Men consistently have higher incidence and mortality rates than women and, in the U.S., blacks have higher incidence and mortality rates than whites . Pancreatic cancer rates are lower in developing countries than in developed countries . Mortality rates in both sexes have increased over the past four decades in a number of countries where rates had been low in the mid-1950s, such as Japan, Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Poland, and Yugoslavia . In Japan, age-standardized mortality rates have jumped from 1.4 per 100,000 to 12.5 per 100,000 in men between 1950 and 1995 , demonstrating that environmental factors play an important role.Tobacco smoking is the one of the few established risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Inherited susceptibility explains a small fraction of pancreatic cancers, but the genes responsible for familial pancreatic cancer have not yet been identified. Late onset diabetes, or type-2 diabetes, has been consistently associated with elevated risks of pancreatic cancer. In a meta-analysis of 20 studies with data on the duration of diabetes prior to pancreatic cancer, individuals with diabetic histories of 5 or more years had a twofold elevation in pancreatic cancer risk compared to those without a history of diabetes, or diabetes of less than 5 years duration . In several recent studies, including three cohort studies, relative risks for pancreatic cancer ranged between 1.3 and 1.7 for individuals with long-standing diabetes , compared to those with no diabetes . The strength and consistency of these studies suggest that a diabetic state, which develops 10 or more years prior to cancer diagnosis, is likely to be related causally to the development of pancreatic tumors.The association between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk may be the result of years of elevated postload glucose concentration, hyperinsulinemia, and gradual impaired glucose tolerance. In a prospective study of nondiabetics in which blood was obtained an average of 25 years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis, postload glucose concentration was directly associated with pancreatic cancer risk in men and women . In a similar prospective study with 10 years of follow-up, positive associations were observed between fasting serum glucose levels and pancreatic cancer mortality in men and women . In that study, conducted in Korea, even modestly elevated fasting serum glucose levels were associated with higher pancreatic cancer mortality in women . These two studies, together with the well-established relation with late onset diabetes, suggest that body weight and insulin resistance may play an important role in the etiology of pancreatic cancer.\n",

      "Human pancreatic tumors are believed to arise from ductal cells because tumors show ductal structure. However, it has been argued that tumors may arise from acinar cells , islets of Langerhans cells, or stem cells and that they appear ductal in shape due to differentiation. In the hamster model amine ), which in many aspects is identical to the human disease, most ductal-type cancers develop within islets . The histogenesis of pancreatic cancer is not well understood and difficult to establish because tumors are not usually detected until late in the progression of the disease.At least two different mechanisms could contribute to a positive association between obesity and pancreatic cancer. The first mechanism described here involves insulin and insulin resistance and may also explain the relation between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. The second mechanism involves gastrointestinal hormones.In vitro studies show that insulin promotes growth of hamster, rat, and numerous human pancreatic cell lines . Although insulin is known to stimulate cell proliferation, it does not appear to be directly responsible in promoting pancreatic cancer, given that administration of exogenous insulin has an inhibitory effect on tumor induction in the hamster pancreatic cancer model . Studies suggest that islet cell turnover, associated with insulin resistance, may play an important role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Stimulation of islet cell proliferation enhances pancreatic ductal carcinogenesis in hamsters , and the destruction of islet cells by streptozotocin or alloxan inhibits cancer induction .In a recent study, hamster pancreatic cancer was inhibited by the drug metformin, which normalized insulin levels and the rate of islet cell turnover . In a cohort study of patients with type-I diabetes , the number of pancreatic cancer cases observed was much lower than expected in those hospitalized with diabetes 15 or more years prior to cancer diagnosis . Although the number of cases is small and results are unstable, this finding supports the hypothesis that islet cell proliferation may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.The second mechanism that may explain the association between obesity and pancreatic cancer may be related to production of gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin or gastrin. Excess caloric intake, which can lead to weight gain, is likely to occur with frequent food consumption. With food intake, gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin and cholecystokinin, are elevated. Cholecystokinin, in turn, stimulates the secretion of enzymes from the exocrine pancreas. Cholecystokinin and gastrin promote growth of numerous pancreatic cancer cell lines . In the ratmodel, endogenous hypergastrinaemia and hypercholecystokininemia induced carcinogenesis in acinar cells of the pancreas . Hypergastrinaemia, however, did not enhance induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster model , and findings of hypercholecystokininemia in hamster models have been inconsistent .\n",

      "Because of the rapidly fatal nature of pancreatic cancer, case-control studies on this cancer typically have low participation rates and rely heavily on next of kin to obtain exposure data. In these circumstances, selection and recall biases are likely to occur. In an attempt to reduce error introduced when including proxy data, some case-control studies have chosen to keep only cases who responded directly to the questions asked. However, these case-control studies are more prone to survival bias because patients with the most aggressive cancers will be too ill or deceased by the time they are identified.When studying body weight, case-control studies of pancreatic cancer may be more prone to recall bias because weight loss often occurs several years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis and is often a primary characteristic leading to the detection of this cancer. Similarly, use of proxies to obtain data on patients 2 years prior to interview may lead to weight misclassification because proxies are less likely to remember the patient's weight accurately. With proxy interviews, error in reporting weight may be random or biased if, for example, proxies consistently underestimate patients' weight. Recall bias due to weight loss and use of proxy interviews may explain why a number of case-control studies failed to observe associations between obesity and pancreatic cancer risk. In contrast, cohort studies are not prone to these types of errors because weight information is collected prior to disease and proxy interviews are not used.Although the cohort study design is optimal to examine weight and pancreatic cancer, this type of study is often limited by power, given that pancreatic cancer incidence is ranked 11th out of all cancers . Consequently, men and women are often combined and numerous years of follow-up must be available to obtain reasonable sample sizes. Another potential limitation, which may apply to either type of study design but is perhaps more common in \"healthy\" cohorts, is weight range; some studies may not be suited to examine body weight if few participants classify as obese. In some cohort studies, the associations between weight and pancreatic cancer mortality have been reported, due to the lack of incidence data. However, mortality studies should lead to similar results, given the high fatality of pancreatic cancer.\n",

      "Results from case-control and cohort studies are summarized in Table 17.1. Four case-control studies observed no association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk . All of these studies relied on proxy interviews to obtain body weight of cases. The largest was a collaborative case-control study that combined data from five studies in four different countries to obtain 802 pancreatic cancer cases . No association with BMI was observed overall or in the five individual centers that contributed to the collaborative casecontrol study; detailed results from two of the five studies were published separately .The four most recent case-control studies were conducted using only direct interviews and had over 300 cases of pancreatic cancer cases each . Positive associations between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk were observed in men and women in all four studies. In two studies , \"usual\" adult weight was reported instead of current weight, which may have helped reduce bias associated with preclinical weight loss.

The fourth study to show a positive association was conducted in an Asian population with relatively low BMI cutpoints for the highest category . To date, this is the only study on weight and pancreatic cancer risk conducted in an Asian population. Studies suggest that Asian populations have a high percentage of body fat for a given BMI and also have higher diabetes or coronary heart disease risk than Europeans at the same BMI . Therefore, it is conceivable that Asians may be at higher risk of pancreatic cancer with a smaller increase in BMI than Caucasians.\n",

      "To date, nine cohort studies have examined the association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk . In two of these studies, risks were calculated for pancreatic cancer mortality . All but three of the cohort studies relied on self-reported weight. The number of pancreatic cancer cases in these cohorts ranged between 65 and 3558 and cohort follow-up time ranged between 7 and 43 years. In the four largest cohorts, significantly elevated risks of pancreatic cancer were observed for obese individuals, compared to those with normal body weight .The Cancer Prevention Study II cohort, the largest study to examine weight and cancer death, included over 900,000 U.S. participants and detected 1908 male and 1650 female pancreatic cancer deaths over 16 years of follow-up . At baseline, participants were asked to report their current weight and their weight 1 year earlier. Individuals who reported having lost more than 10 lb over the previous year were excluded from the analyses. The strongest relative risk of pancreatic cancer death was observed among women with BMI≥40 kg/m² , compared to women with BMI < 25 kg/m². Relative risks were also elevated among men with BMI >35 and women with BMI between 35 and 39.9 , compared to men and women with normal BMI . Among men, the association between BMI and pancreatic cancer death was stronger when the analysis was restricted to those who had never smoked .In a subset of the larger CPS-II cohort , 242 incident pancreatic cancer cases were detected over a 7-year follow-up period . A similar association was observed in this study for obesity and risk of pancreatic cancer among men and women . In addition, an independent association was observed for central weight gain, compared with peripheral weight gain, after adjusting for BMI .Obesity was also associated with elevated risk of incident pancreatic cancer in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts . Weight was reported at baseline in each cohort and a total of 350 incident pancreatic cancer cases were included in the analyses . Similar associations were observed for men and women with BMI ≥ 30, compared to BMI < 23 . Tests for trend were statistically significant in both cohorts.Four cohorts reported no association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk ; in a fifth, an association was detected among men but not women . A narrow weight range and limited statistical power may explain why some of these studies failed to detect an association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk. In one of the studies, which consisted largely of elderly participants living in a retirement community, few participants were overweight . Small casenumbers were another limitation to this study. In the College Alumni Health Study, the top BMI category cutpoint was 27.5 and only 10% of participants fell into that category. In the Chicago Heart Association cohort study, in which no association was detected among women, the top BMI category cutpoint was 26.2 for women and only 43 cases were women.In a study of male smokers, no association was detected for weight and pancreatic cancer risk, even with a wide range in BMI . It is conceivable that the association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk does not apply to heavy smokers. As mentioned above, in the CPS-II cohort, men who had never smoked had a much stronger association between BMI and pancreatic cancer death .Results from a Swedish Twin Registry cohort also reported no association with weight, even among obese individuals . However, the same study found an increase in risk of pancreatic cancer among those who reported an adult weight gain of 12 kg or more compared to those who gained 2 to 5 kg .In a different Swedish cohort, body weight was not reported, but weight gain was . This study consisted of 35,000 men and women who participated in a general health examination in Malmö, Sweden, between 1974 and 1992. Incidence and mortality of cancer were obtained through linkage with the Cause of Death Register and the National Cancer Register; 43 pancreatic cancer cases were detected during follow-up. The authors reported a relative risk of 2.4 for a greater than 10 kg increase in body weight since age 30 years, compared to all others, after controlling for smoking.\n",

      "Besides tobacco smoking, type-2 diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for pancreatic cancer. A causal association with type-2 diabetes is likely to exist because a number of studies observe elevated risks of pancreatic cancer with long-standing diabetes. The association between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk may be due to elevated postload glucose concentration, hyperinsulinemia, and resulting insulin resistance, suggesting that body weight may also play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.Earlier studies examining body weight and pancreatic cancer risk offered no indication that weight may be a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. Methodological issues in case-control studies, especially regarding the use of proxies, may explain the observed null results. More recent casecontrol studies using only direct interviews reported elevated risks of pancreatic cancer among men and women with elevated BMIs. A number of recent cohort studies observed similar associations. The largest cohort study , including 3558 pancreatic cancer cases, reported relative risks of mortality between 1.5 and 2.8 for obese men and women, compared to normal weight. The association in men was strongest among those who had never smoked.Overall, animal and human studies suggest that a positive association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk exists. The association may be strongest among men and women who are considered obese . Future studies need to focus on the effects of physical activity.\n",

      "Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related morbidity and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death. Squamous cell carcinoma is still the predominant histological subtype worldwide, although incidence of this subtype is stable or decreasing . Among men, African Americans are at a nearly sixfold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus compared to white men; however, risk among white men is four times higher for adenocarcinomas compared to that of African Americans. Among women, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma is lower than that of men, but is similar by race .Incidence of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and in the closely linked gastric cardia has increased rapidly for at least 30 years. In the United States, Devesa reported a crossover of the esophageal histological subtypes in the mid-1990s; adenocarcinomas became the predominant subtype, rather than squamous cell carcinoma, making it the fastest increasing cancer to date. These patterns are evident among men and women, although rates are much lower among women .Reasons for the rapid increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma reported in most industrialized countries are not clear, but parallel an equally rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity and overweight status. Based on a representative sample of adult Americans, the estimated prevalence of obesity, defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m² or more, increased from 12% in 1991 to 18% in 1998 . By 2001, this prevalence had increased to 21% , representing a 75% increase in a 10-year period. In the U.S., approximately 60% of the adult population is currently overweight or obese . Among obese individuals, the steepest increases have been reported among those with BMI of >40 kg/m², for whom prevalence has increased by a factor of four in the last 10 years . Because ofunder-reporting of weight increases with the respondent's actual weight, a prevalence estimate of 60%, which is based on self-reports, is likely an underestimate.Obesity is associated with all-cause mortality and with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases , diabetes, cancers of the colon, rectum, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, breast, corpus uterus, cervix, ovary, and kidney, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma . As reviewed in this chapter, obesity has also been recently associated with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia; these associations are independent of known risk factors, including cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.Up to 90% of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus can be attributed to the synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use , and the precipitous decrease in the incidence of this histological subtype in the U.S. has been attributed to decreases in tobacco use. The strength of the association between alcohol and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastric cardia is weaker . Recent evidence suggests that the risk of such adenocarcinomas is also inversely associated with gastrointestinal infection with Helicobacter pylori . However, strong evidence also implicates overweight and obesity in the etiology of these adenocarcinomas . Cases of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia are more likely than controls to have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, or Barrett's metaplasia . These conditions, which are considered precursors to esophageal adenocarcinoma , are also common among overweight and obese individuals.The mechanisms by which obesity could increase risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma are unclear; mechanical as well as biochemical hypotheses have been proposed. Central obesity may predispose individuals to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus by initiating a cascade of events, beginning with hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which predominantly affects the gastroesophageal junction . Constant irritation of squamous cells in the lower third of the esophagus is thought to invoke a compensatory response that gives rise to Barrett's metaplasia, in which squamous cells are gradually replaced by columnar cells.Although a small proportion of patients with Barrett's metaplasia eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma, the condition is considered a precursor for this adenocarcinoma. In this model, digestive enzymes, including gastric and bile acids, may irritate and cause inflammation on the esophagus, leading to hyperproliferation of columnar cells less vulnerable to refluxate, constituting the first \"hit.\" This may eventually lead to low-grade and then premalignant, high-grade dysplastic changes in the esophagus, which in turn may lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This hypothesis is consistent with the multistep process of carcinogenesis . Some epidemiological evidence implicates obesity in the etiology of Barrett's metaplasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, as reviewed next.\n",

      "A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify epidemiological studies that examined obesity or overweight status in relation to: esophageal adenocarcinoma; the closely related tumor, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma: the precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus; and gastroesophageal reflux disease. A computerized search of English language publications was performed up to June 2004 using MEDLINE online database as well as manual searches of abstract lists for recent cancer or epidemiology conferences and the reference lists of all relevant articles. Most articles evaluated the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus separately from those of the gastric cardia; however. some early studies combined the two anatomical subtypes together in a single outcome group because of the belief that the two share a common etiology. Whether this latter assumption is correct remains unresolved.The standard clinical and epidemiological assessment of obesity, weight for height or BMI, was used in many of the studies identified for this review. The World Health Organization defines a BMI of 25 kg/m² or greater as overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m² as obese . Circumferences of the hip and waist have traditionally been used to estimate fat distribution in epidemiologicalstudies. Centralized obesity, as assessed by the waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio, has been shown to be associated strongly with adult weight gain . Although the validity of each of these measures remains an active topic of investigation, the test and retest reliability of BMI with total body fat and waist-to-hip ratio with central obesity and visceral adipose tissue accumulation are high . Central obesity, which represents an aberrant fat accumulation, may be as important as BMI and may be a more potent adiposity phenotype and a better predictor of chronic disease.\n",

      "Table 18.1 summarizes results from 13 case-control studies and one cohort study that investigated the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma risk and obesity . The investigations were conducted between 1986 and 2001 in a variety of Western countries, including the U.S., Sweden, Norway, Italy, Great Britain, and Germany. Most studies estimated obesity using BMI, which was calculated based on the study participants' recall of usual adult weight, defined as weight ranging from 1 to 20 years prior to the study interview. Weight at specific ages, such as 20 or 40 years of age, was also based on recall. Height, measured or self-reported at interview following disease onset, together with recalled weight, was commonly used to compute BMI.Using BMI 1 year prior to the interview as a proxy for usual BMI, all but three studies reported a dose-dependent increase in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in relation to obesity. The estimates of the magnitude of the association ranged from an odds ratio of 2.5 to 3.1, when individuals in the lowest quartile of usual or current BMI were compared to those in the highest quartiles. Although fourfold increases in risk were also reported among German men , these findings were based on a small number of cases. The two- to threefold increase in risk varied little across populations, despite different cut-points, suggesting perhaps that the relative fat deposits, and not absolute cut-point values of BMI, are important.The timing of obesity relative to the onset of esophageal adenocarcinoma also appeared to influence risk. When the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and BMI at specific ages, such as BMI at age 20 , was evaluated, the magnitude of the association between obesity and esophageal adenocarcinoma was even stronger. In a Swedish case-control study, Lagergren reported a 16-fold increase in risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus among individuals with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m² some 20 years before the interview, when compared to those with a BMI less than 22 kg/m2. The significance of these findings is unclear because others have reported that the magnitude of the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity at age 20 or at age 40 years was similar; however, the association was slightly stronger among subjects who reported obesity at age 20 than among those who were obese at age 40. One interpretation of these findings is that the duration of obesity during adulthood, rather than obesity in the period surrounding diagnosis, may be the important factor in the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma.Few studies evaluated duration of obesity directly, and instead relied on participants to recall weight at different ages to estimate duration. A very strong association between duration of obesity and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was found among British women , although the highest quartile included those with a BMI of <23 kg/m². Confirming these results, Chak reported a dose-dependent increase in risk with increasing duration of obesity. However, in these studies , the number of cases involved was small and estimates were imprecise.Although most studies combined men and women in the final analyses, studies that provided results stratified by sex suggest that obesity may have a less detrimental effect among women than among men, although these findings are not consistent. In a cohort study, Tretli reported a more than twofold increase in risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma among men in the fourth BMI quartile and no evidence of such an association in women. In the British study that included only women, however, BMI at age 20 was associated with a more than sixfold increase in esophageal\n",

      "adenocarcinoma risk, although the number of study cases was small . Differences between men and women suggest that, rather than total body fat, central adiposity, which is more common in men, may be the important factor involved in the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma.The few studies unable to document an association with obesity were hospital based , or combined adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia with those of the esophagus to form a single outcome group . Because obesity is associated with many chronic conditions, the prevalence of obesity among hospital-based controls may be higher than that in the general population. Thus, case-control studies that utilize hospital-based controls in an investigation of obesity would be expected to underestimate an association. In addition, due to the anatomical proximity of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, the earlier studies presented findings from analyses that combined these as a single disease endpoint . Collapsing the two tumors into a single outcome may increase statistical power; however, the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma may be distinct from those of the gastric cardia. Thus, if the relation with obesity varies by anatomical subtype, findings from studies combining the two could be misleading. It is therefore not surprising that, of the three studies that combined anatomical sites or used hospital-based controls, only one found statistically significant differences in obesity between cases and controls.\n",

      "Table 18.2 summarizes results from the six case-control studies that evaluated the association between obesity and the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma . These studies were conducted in China, Sweden, and the U.S. Five of the six studies found a weak to moderate, dose-dependent increase in risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma with increasing obesity. In four studies , these associations were weaker than those reported for the association between BMI and esophageal adenocarcinoma.These epidemiological studies usually included assessment of BMI at interview, or relied on an estimate of usual adult BMI, which was commonly based on self-reported weight in the year prior to the interview. In some studies, participants were also asked to recall their weight at age 20 or 40 years or 20 years prior to the interview; thus, estimates of adult weight change could also be calculated.In studies that evaluated duration, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma increased with time since the participant was first obese. The magnitude of the association for an increased BMI 1 year prior to the interview was weak to moderate, whereas the magnitude in relation to increased BMI some 20 to 50 years prior to disease onset was moderate to strong . Compared to individuals in the lowest quartile of BMI 1 year prior to the interview , those in the highest category of BMI were at 60% increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. BMI at age 40 years or 20 years prior to the interview was associated with two- to threefold increase in risk. Recalled usual BMI was associated with up to a fourfold increase in risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in men, suggesting that prolonged periods of central obesity in adulthood may be etiologically linked to these tumors. As would be expected if the association was causal, duration of obesity during the course of adulthood appears important.Most, but not all, studies found that the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma associated with obesity varied by sex. In a generally lean Chinese population-based case-control study, Ji and colleagues reported up to sixfold increased risk of gastric cardia cancers associated with increasing BMI, but the association was stronger among men than women. As with esophageal adenocarcinoma, weight change during adulthood was not associated with increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma .Although theses studies show a positive association between obesity and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, particularly among men, a limitation among them is that body fat was more commonly assessed using BMI rather than the more pertinent waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Central obesity is more common in men and is more relevant to the postulated hypothesis of intra-abdominal pressure. However, estimates of central obesity are particularly difficult to obtain accurately and reliably in a case-control study. Future studies may benefit from inquiring retrospectively about waist and hip circumference using proxy measures such as clothing size, similar to breast cancer studies that include assessment of brassiere size. Although precise estimates could not be obtained from such an inquiry, the relative measure and duration could be evaluated.\n",

      "Table 18.3 summarizes the results from four studies evaluating the association between obesity and Barrett's esophagus that were conducted in the U.S. and the U.K. . In these studies, obesity was estimated using BMI, weight, weight change, and waist-to-hip ratio. In a British cross-sectional study of Barrett's esophagus patients, Caygill reported a strong association with high BMI among patients younger than 50 years, but this association was not apparent among patients 50 years and older. These findings were corroborated in a study based on 51 Barrett's esophagus patients that was conducted by Moe . The authors found that diet and nutritional status were associated with elevated cell proliferative fractions in patients. Among these patients, 45% of cases had a high BMI and elevated waist-to-hip ratio was significantly associated with the mean and maximum %S phase cells. Weight change was also associated with the mean and maximum percentage of cells in the G2 phase.In contrast, Gerson reported no association between adult weight change and Barrett's in a study of 110 individuals aged 50 years or more who were undergoing sigmoidoscopy. Finally, in a much larger follow-up study of over 400 Barrett's esophagus patients, Vaughan found a consistent association with higher waist-to-hip ratio that was stronger among men than women.

      "markers of Barrett's esophagus, including higher grade esophageal dysplasia, increased aneuploidy, and loss of heterozygosity in tumor suppressors 9p and 17p.Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity increases the risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adecarcinoma by acting early and influencing risk of Barrett's esophagus. Although this cascade of events may be initiated by intra-abdominal pressure, it might also occur through alteration of growth factors, hormones, or metabolic factors that regulate cell growth . Abdominal obesity is associated with hyperinsulinemia, leptin, and free fatty acids . Insulin also affects the levels of circulating insulin-like growth factors and their binding protein. Association studies relating these factors to Barrett's esophagus are currently underway .Obesity's effects may act early in the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, possibly by increasing risk of hiatal hernia and subsequent gastroesophageal reflux disease . Obesity has also been associated with cell cycle abnormalities assessed using content flow cytometry to estimate the proportion of proliferating cells, fraction of cells in each phase of the cell cycle . Also, the presence of aneuploid cell populations is more common among patients with Barrett's esophagus compared to otherwise healthy individuals . Recent studies have reported an association between genetic and cell cycle abnormalities, including aneploidy and loss of heterozygosity on 9p and 17p , in relation to increased central obesity as measured by waist-to-hip ratio. In one of these studies , women had on average a larger BMI ; however, their waist-to-hip ratio was lower . This mayexplain in part the preponderance of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas among men. These findings also suggest that, in the presence of Barrett's esophagus, fat distribution may be more important than BMI.\n",

      "Table 18.4 summarizes observational and experimental studies evaluating the relationship between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. These studies were conducted in Italy, the U.K., Norway, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. Eight of the ten studies, of which some were randomized clinical trials, reported a moderate to strong dose-dependent increase in risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease among overweight and obese individuals. When compared to those who were in the lowest category of BMI , individuals at the highest category of BMI had an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease, heartburn, or hiatal hernja.In a large U.K. population-based cross-sectional study of over 27,000 individuals, a larger BMI was associated with nearly threefold increase in risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, including heartburn and regurgitation, that was independent of confounding factors such as dyspeptic symptoms . In a cross-sectional study of 1524 otherwise healthy individuals, Locke also reported a strong association between gastroesophageal reflux disease and BMI. NHANES 1 follow-up data of nearly 20 years showed that hospitalization for gastroesophageal reflux disease was related to BMI . Most importantly, a British study found that, among obese patients who lost an average of 4 kg. gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were reduced significantly. These latter findings have since been confirmed in another investigation in which a higher frequency of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction and gastroesophageal reflux disease was found among patients who remained obese, compared to those who lost weight during the 8-month study period .The association between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease has not been found in all studies, however, including several large population-based studies and randomized clinical trials . Among a Swedish population , no significant changes in gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were noted after an average weight loss of more than 9 kg.A limitation in the interpretation of these findings is that none of the studies evaluated the role of central obesity as measured by waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. The timing of the relevant exposure period varies across studies, with some assessing obesity at diagnosis and others assessing obesity at varying adult ages. Furthermore, the randomized clinical trials evaluated the effect of obesity on gastroesophageal reflux disease predominantly among the morbidly obese, making generalizability difficult. Despite these shortcomings, on the whole, these studies suggest that obesity increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n",

      "The available epidemiological evidence suggests a positive association between obesity and the risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, as well as with the precursors, including Barrett's metaplasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. As would be expected if the association were causal, this association increases with severity and duration of obesity. It also appears to be more common among men than women, suggesting that central obesity may be the important factor.The mechanism underlying the association between obesity and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia is unknown; however, several competing hypotheses have been proposed. One is that obesity exacerbates gastroesophageal reflux disease through increased intra-abdominal pressure and the subsequent development of hiatal hernia . More characteristic of Western populations, mechanical pressure from central obesity is exacerbated by tight belts and is hypothesized to give rise to the encroachment of columnar metaplasia, a compensatory response to the corrosive effects of digestive enzymes, including gastric and bile acids.

      "of columnar epithelium is a recognized precursor for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. This model is compatible with the multistep process of carcinogenesis, in which central obesity and then gastroesophageal disease are the initial steps that may be followed by the development of low-grade and then high-grade dysplastic changes in the gastrointestinal tract. This hypothesis is also compatible with disease preponderance among men. However, it does not explain the lower incidence among African American men who have a larger body size .Overweight status and obesity are a result of energy balance stores that are too large compared to energy output. Obesity results from high energy intake or low expenditure, or both, and reflects an interplay between heritable genetic factors involved in growth, and environmental factors that may alter endocrine function, including secretion of insulin, sex steroid, and growth hormone . Approximately 25% of obesity can be attributed to genetic factors , although the precise loci involved are unknown. The most atherogenic fat deposit of the human body is thought to be in the abdominal cavity, around the viscera, particularly the fat deposits with small blood vessels draining into the portal vein that carries blood back to the liver . This hypothesis is supported by findings that men, who tend to have a large waist circumference, are at greater risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas compared to women, in whom excess fat is predominantly deposited on thighs and buttocks.First proposed by Mercer , the prolonged esophageal transit time observed for solid foods is longer, on average, in obese persons compared to lean individuals. This could theoretically increase contact time for carcinogens present in food. Mercer reported observing a significantly longer esophageal transit time among obese individuals compared to lean patients, even though both patient groups had been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, the authors did not provide usual food types consumed or their composition to enable speculation on possible carcinogens that may have been involved. Some evidence suggests a slower transit time for foods with a high fat content compared to those without it, so disease risk may be associated with dietary fat rather than transit time. Testing this hypothesis has not received much attention because differences in the duration of exposure to any given carcinogen is probably marginal during swallowing.Another hypothesis posited is that of increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Elevated IGF circulating levels may enhance cell proliferation, resulting in a larger than normal number of cell divisions and increased opportunities for genetic accidents . Also, because insulin-like growth factors inhibit apoptosis, the probability of survival of cells with the \"single hit\" is increased, thus increasing the pool of cells available for subsequent \"hits\" and consequent transformation. Elevated circulating levels of insulin-like growth factors may also influence the probability of progression to clinically apparent or aggressive disease.Obese individuals are characterized by insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and increased production of insulin-like growth factors . A recent study on the oversecretion of IGF-I and IGF-II in gastric cancer cells reported that the major binding protein, IGFBP-3, was secreted only in approximately half of the cells. Inoculation of cells with IGF-I and IGF-II resulted in proliferation. Elevated levels of IGF-I have been associated with increased risk of cancers of the breast in younger women , prostate , and colon . Elevated levels of IGFBP-3, relative to IGF-I, have also been associated with decreased risk of breast and prostate cancer.In addition, IGF-II has been implicated in the paracrine growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cells in vitro . Dose-dependent, two- to threefold increases in risk have also been reported with colorectal cancer among individuals with elevated IGF-II levels , although the relationships failed to achieve statistical significance. Intra-abdominal fat stores may act as the first \"hit\" by altering metabolism of insulin, increasing generalized proliferative response as a result of elevated insulin or IGF levels. IGFs may also inhibit apoptosis so that the theoretical probability of survival of cells with a single hit is increased, thus increasing the pool of cells available for subsequent hits and consequent transformation. However, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia or elevated IGF levels is unknown and, although the contribution of hyperinsulinemia to esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas has been speculated about widely, this remains unknown.Excess body fat may also increase risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by modifying the effect of a yet unidentified environmental carcinogen. If such an agent were sequestered in fat tissue, body fat could be associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on this hypothesis, differences in risk among various subpopulations could therefore reflect differences in the intensity and duration of obesity. This hypothesis remains intriguing, despite the lack of data to support it, because of its potential to explain racial differences in disease risk. For example, although obesity is a plausible underlying cause of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia, it is still unclear why incidence differs markedly between African Americans and whites living in the U.S., given that recent national data suggest that African American men have a higher BMI than white men do . Of note, however is that abdominal visceral adiposity rather than overall size by BMI may explain, in part, racial differences in risk of these adenocarcinomas. Recent evidence suggests that, at a given BMI, white males and females have a higher waist circumference than African Americans and, presumably, visceral fat .DNA damage caused by a mixture of environmental exposures may require the base excision or strand break repair. In epidemiological and animal studies, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are associated with increased obesity, and weight loss among the morbidly obese decreases oxidative stress and increases antioxidant activity . Base excision repair targets DNA damage associated with oxidative stress, although it may also repair strand breaks and nonbulky adducts induced by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation and tobacco smoke . Carcinogen-induced DNA damage and cellular damage induced by inflammation during hyperkeritization may play a role in the carcinogenesis of the esophagus and gastric cardia. The precise mechanism involved in obesity and oxidative stress is complex; however, the insulin resistance common in obesity is associated with oxidative stress in humans .DNA repair capacity is variable in human populations and a part of that variation is believed to be genetic. A reduction in efficiency of any one pathway may increase risk of replicating damaged or transformed cells. DNA repair capacity has been evaluated by comparing polymorphisms in base excision and nucleotide excision repair pathways in relation to risk of cancers of the breast , prostate , lung , skin , and head and neck . In vitro studies of other adenocarcinomas, including pancreatic and prostate tissue, have shown that DNA adducts form after exposure to environmental toxins and intake of diets with antioxidative properties has been shown to decrease prostate cancer risk through inactivation of reactive oxygen species . In support of this hypothesis, Brown reported an inverse association between increased fiber intake and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. To date, no studies have evaluated whether DNA repair capacity may play an important role in the development of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.A suboptimal ability to mount a cellular immune response has been implicated in the development of several adenocarcinomas and has also been associated with obesity . Several animal studies have also linked obesity with impaired immune response . Cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators have been implicated in inflammatory Barrett's metaplasia . Cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors have various biological functions, including the inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Proinflammatory chemokines and their receptors are expressed in esophageal and gastric cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells within esophageal tumors. Proinflammatory gene polymorphisms in combination with proinflammatory conditions exacerbated by obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, accompanied by sloughing of basal cells, hyperkeratinization and hyperproliferation, may influence the development of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma.Humoral immunity in tissue found in the gastrointestinal tract is characterized by the production of immunoglobulin A and the CC chemokines CCR2, CCR4, and CCR9 are expressed by esophageal and intestinal epithelial cells . Solid tumor and leukemic cells expressing chemokine receptors have been shown to metastasize to chemokine-secreting organs . Chemokines may indirectly affect tumor development by attracting immunocompetent cells with pro- or antitumoral activities. Chemokine receptors mediate the migration of lymphocytes through the binding of ligands, and the expression is differentially regulated in lymphocyte subsets.Cytokines such as interferon -alpha and gamma are also known potent immune modulators that can inhibit or enhance immune cell activity within the tightly regulated microenvironment of inflammation, depending upon the concentration of the cytokine and the activation stage of the cell. Among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, increases in several cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-alpha-2b, CC chemokines CXR3, CCR7, and CXR4, were shown to increase with increasing disease severity . Animals deficient in CCR4 and CCR9 have also shown a reduced IgA immune response . CCR9 has been identified as the chemokine receptor regulating lymphocyte trafficking during T-cell development and in mucosal immunity .\n",

      "The incidence of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas has been increasing rapidly in the last 30 years, and the etiology of these adenocarcinomas is not fully understood. The temporal, gender, and geographic variation for adenocarcinomas of gastric cardia and esophagus, together with suggestions of familial aggregation of these adenocarcinomas, suggests the importance of environmental factors whose intensity of exposure has increased in the last 30 to 40 years. Obesity has been associated with esophageal and gastric cardia risk as well as its precursors, including Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If causally related, obesity may act early in carcinogenesis through increased intra-abdominal pressure, followed by gastroesophageal reflux disease, the deregulation of the cell cycle, Barrett's esophagus, and the dysplasia, and eventually leading to adenocarcinoma.The lower incidence among women, despite a similar prevalence of obesity in specific subpopulations, and the high prevalence of adenocarcinomas in geographic regions where the prevalence of obesity is moderate suggest that central obesity, more frequently occurring in men, may be the important factor in the etiology of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. However, correlates of central obesity, such as waist-to-hip ratio and weight gain, have not been consistently linked to risk of these tumors. Whether this is due to the challenges associated with accurately assessing these latter measures in epidemiological research, particularly using a case-control design, needs to be clarified. Furthermore, if obesity is causally related to gastric cardia and esophageal adenocarcinomas, the lower risk of cancer among African Americans, who generally have a higher prevalence of obesity, needs to be reconciled. Molecular epidemiological studies of esophageal cancer may help to elucidate these issues.Assessment of obesity in epidemiological research is subject to misclassification, and may vary by gender, in that women may under-report and men may over-report body size. Consistent with this possibility, such misclassification would result in an overestimation of the risk associated withobesity among men and an underestimation of risk among women. Although long-term cohort studies would be ideal, determining the role of obesity in the development of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia can be achieved by carefully designed, population-based, casecontrol studies. Disentangling the effects of obesity from other competing factors will require studies to capture retrospectively fat distribution parameters and changes in these parameters over time during adulthood.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity increase risk for the development of several types of cancer, including postmenopausal breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, lower esophagus, pancreas, and, perhaps, ovary and thyroid cancers . Once individuals develop cancer, depending on the site, they may be at increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival if they are overweight or obese. Several potential mechanisms might explain the link between increased adiposity and increased cancer risk, including hormonal, inflammatory, and immune system effects.

      "Adipose tissue constitutes an active endocrine and metabolic organ that can have far-reaching effects on the physiology of other tissues . In response to endocrine and metabolic signals from other organs, adipose tissue responds by increases or decreases in the release of free fatty acids - an energy-providing fuel for skeletal muscle and other tissues. It plays an active role in the regulation of energy balance and lipid metabolism through the release of several peptide hormones, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha . Increased adipose tissue release of free fatty acids, resistin, and TNFcx, as well as reduced release of adiponectin, in turn give rise to insulin resistance - a metabolic state characterized by reduced metabolic response of tissues to insulin - and to compensatory hyperinsulinemia .In addition to its role in regulating energy balance, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue expresses various steroid hormone metabolizing enzymes and, especially in postmenopausal women and men, is an important source of circulating estrogens .\n",

      "Epidemiological studies have provided substantial evidence that adiposity-induced alterations in circulating levels of sex steroids could in large part explain the associations observed between anthropometric indices of excess weight and risks of cancers of the breast and endometrium pre- and postmenopasual women) . For these two tissue types, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence also indicates the central role of estrogens, androgens, and progesterone in regulating cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis induction .A recent combined analysis of nested case-control data from nine cohort studies, with data from 663 breast cancer cases and 1765 women without breast cancer, showed that postmenopausal women with elevated estrogen or androgen levels have increased risk for developing breast cancer . Women with blood hormone concentrations in the top quintile for estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone , and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were approximately twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with women with serum hormones in the bottom quintile, and the trends were highly statistically significant. Furthermore, risk was inversely related to blood levels of sex hormone-binding globulin .Further analyses of these nine pooled cohort studies indicated that the association of body mass index with breast cancer risk could be attributed almost entirely to increasing blood levels of total or bioavailable estradiol with increasing BMI . Taken together, these studies indicate that much, if not all, of the BMI-breast cancer relationship can be explained by the adiposity-related increase in endogenous estrogen levels.Further evidence that increased estrogen levels may underlie the association between BMI and breast cancer comes from studies of menopausal hormone therapy. BMI is more strongly related to risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women who have never used menopausal hormone therapy, compared to women who did use these hormones . A likely interpretation of this is that only among women whose levels of estrogens are low does increased adiposity lead to a rise in breast cancer risk, but not among women whose circulating estrogens are already high due to menopausal hormone therapy use. Finally, mortality is higher among heavier women with breast cancer thanamong leaner women, and some studies indicate that the association of elevated BMI with poorer prognosis is more pronounced among women with estrogen receptor -positive tumors .With regard to endometrial cancer, a number of case-control studies and prospective studies have shown increased cancer risks among pre- and postmenopausal women who have comparatively low plasma levels of SHBG and high levels of the androgens Δ4-androstenedione and testosterone. In one prospective study, risk was also found to be directly related to postmenopausal serum levels of estrone and total and bioavailable estradiol with estimated relative risks up to about 5.0 for women in the upper quartiles or quintiles of estradiol levels . In premenopausal women, endometrial cancer risk is also elevated among women with polycystic ovary syndrome , which often develops together with, and in large extent as a consequence of, chronic hyperinsulinemia and is generally related to progesterone deficiency.These various relationships all fit a coherent physiologic model in line with the \"unopposed estrogen\" theory and endometrial cancer . This widely theory is based on a diverse body of evidence, including the association between endometrial cancer and the use of unopposed estrogen therapy. It stipulates that endometrial cancer development is enhanced by the mitogenic effects of estrogens when these are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone.Among men, prostate cancer development is also thought to be related to endogenous hormone metabolism, such as by androgen production . However, excess weight does not appear to be a key risk factor for prostate cancer, with the possible exception of advanced disease. Indeed, one hypothesis is that obese men, who have high estrogen and low testosterone levels compared with lighter weight men, may have lower risk of prostate cancer due to these hormonal imbalances . Furthermore, risk for prostate cancer is not consistently associated with increase in circulating total or bioavailable testosterone, or other androgens . One prospective cohort study suggests that men with high estradiol levels and men with low testosterone levels may be at reduced risk for prostate cancer .\n",

      "Estrogens can promote growth of several hormone-dependent tumors, particularly breast and endometrium; conversely, antiestrogens or withdrawal of endogenous estrogens are effective adjuvant treatments for breast cancer . Postmenopausal women produce estrogens in fat and other tissue through the aromatization of androgens to estrogens . The enzyme aromatase is abundantly present in adipose tissue, especially subcutaneous fat. Estrogens are tumor promoters in vitro and in vivo, and women with high circulating levels of estrogens are at increased risk of developing breast cancer .After menopause, the ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone ceases, but the production of various androgens continues. Most women continue to have detectable concentrations of circulating estrogen after menopause, however; the most prevalent is estrone . After menopause, estrone is produced predominantly through the peripheral conversion, mostly in adipose tissue of adrenal androstenedione . Estradiol, the most metabolically active of the estrogens, is produced in postmenopausal women through the reduction of estrone and the aromatization of ovarian and adrenal testosterone. In postmenopausal women, about 55% of circulating estradiol is bound to SHBG, whereas only a small fraction circulates in the \"free\" state; most of the remainder is bound to albumin . The free and albumin-bound fractions can diffuse from the circulation toward target tissues, and is termed \"bioavailable\" estradiol. Testosterone is produced in postmenopausal women in the ovaries and adrenals; women who have had bilateral oophorectomies have lower concentrations of testosterone compared with women with intact ovaries .Several cross-sectional epidemiological studies have found that postmenopausal women who are overweight or obese have elevated concentrations of estrogens compared with lighter weight women. Researchers in the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study investigated the relationship between plasma concentrations of estradiol and SHBG and breast cancer risk factors in 456 healthy postmenopausal women . Increased adiposity was directly associated with increased estradiol and decreased SHBG concentrations . Women whose BMI was more than 27.5 kg/m2 had a mean estradiol concentration that was almost two times greater than that of women whose BMI was less than 20 kg/m2. The greatest increase in estradiol concentration was observed between those with BMI greater than 27.5 kg/m2 compared with those with BMI lower than this level. SHBG concentrations were also negatively associated with increasing tertile of waist-to-hip ratio .In a study of 420 postmenopausal women without cancer in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, BMI, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were positively associated with concentrations of estrone and estradiol and significantly negatively associated with SHBG concentrations, although not all of the associations were statistically significant . A cross-sectional analysis of 443 postmenopausal women in New York, Sweden, and Italy found that increased adiposity was significantly positively associated with estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol . SHBG was significantly negatively associated with BMI. In a subsample of 217 participants in the Nurses Health Study, BMI was positively associated with plasma concentrations of estrogens, with multivariate-adjusted correlations ranging from 0.37 for estrone and estrone sulfate to 0.63 for bioavailable estradiol, with all p ≤ 0.01 .In a cross-sectional study of 144 healthy postmenopausal Chinese women, estrone and estradiol levels increased with high BMI; the respective levels were 41% and 17% higher among women in the highest BMI category compared with those in the lowest category . In a study of 663 postmenopausal women with and without impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type-2 diabetes from the Rancho Bernardo Study, those with a BMI ≥ 27 had higher serum estradiol and bioavailable estradiol compared with leaner men . Women with a waistto-hip ratio of 0.85 or greater had statistically significantly higher levels of estradiol and bioavailable estradiol . Several other crosssectional studies have also found a positive association between increased adiposity and increased levels of estrogen and decreased levels of SHBG in healthy postmenopausal women .Adiposity has also been found to be similarly related to sex hormone blood concentrations in breast cancer patients . In a population-based cohort of 505 postmenopausal women with Stage 0-3a breast cancer , adiposity was positively and statistically significantly associated with circulating levels of estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol . Women were identified to this study through the SEER cancer registries of Western Washington and New Mexico and were primarily non-Hispanic and Hispanic whites. Between 4 and 12 months after diagnosis, anthropometric measures and blood draws were obtained on all women and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were obtained on 415 women. Obese women had 35% higher concentrations of estrone and 130% higher concentrations of estradiol, compared with lighter women . Similar associations were observed for DEXA-derived body fat mass and percent body fat, and waist circumference. Concentrations of free estradiol were doubled to tripled in overweight and obese women compared with lighter weight women .Further evidence of an association between adipose tissue stores and circulating estrogen concentrations comes from intervention studies resulting in fat loss. Wu et al. conducted a metaanalysis of low-fat dietary intervention studies, of which four were in postmenopausal women . None of the data in these publications included randomized controls. Three of the four studies found significant reductions in estradiol level after 3 weeks to 5 months of intervention. All of these three interventions also produced weight loss, ranging from 1.4 to 3.4 kg . In the onestudy that did not produce weight loss, estradiol levels increased after 2 months . Therefore, a reasonable question remains of whether the change in estradiol was due to the dietary fat change or to the loss of adipose tissue.Exercise-induced fat loss also results in reductions in circulating estrogens. In the Physical Activity for Total Health Study , a 1-year moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program produced statistically significant reductions in estrogens. The effect was limited to women who lost body fat: women whose percentage of body fat decreased by >2% had statistically significant decreases at 12 months of 11.9, 13.7, and 16.7% for serum estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol, respectively .\n",

      "Adiposity influences the synthesis and bioavailability of endogenous sex steroids through at least three mechanisms. First, adipose tissue expresses a variety of sex steroid metabolizing enzymes for the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors secreted by the gonads or adrenal glands. In postmenopausal women and in men, adipose tissue is a major site of estrogen synthesis and BMI is directly related to circulating levels of estrone and estradiol as described earlier .Second, through an increase in circulating insulin, adiposity reduces the hepatic synthesis and blood concentrations of SHBG, a plasmatic binding protein with high specific affinity for testosterone and estradiol . In men and women, adiposity-related decreases in SHBG levels generally increase the fraction of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG. In women only, decreases in SHBG generally also lead to increased levels of bioavailable testosterone . In men, by contrast, decreases in SHBG generally entail reductions in total testicular testosterone production and no increase in bioavailable testosterone .Finally, elevated insulin has been shown to enhance androgen synthesis in ovarian cell and tissue in vitro and chronic hyperinsulinemia has been strong]y implicated in the development of syndromes of excess ovarian androgen production . The polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by ovarian hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and progesterone deficiency ; it is a relatively frequent syndrome, with an estimated prevalence of around 4 to 6% of premenopausal women. In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, fasting serum insulin levels are directly correlated with serum androgen concentrations, but in normoandrogenic women, such correlation has not generally been observed . Nevertheless, because of reductions in serum SHBG, insulin levels do generally correlate positively with levels of bioavailable testosterone, unbound to SHBG, in women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome.\n",

      "Overweight, obese, and sedentary postmenopausal women have elevated concentrations of circulating total and free androgens, which may be due to increased amounts of 178-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. A combined analysis of nested case-control studies within nine cohort studies, which included data from 663 breast cancer cases and 1765 women without breast cancer, found that postmenopausal women with serum hormone concentrations in the top quintile for testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, and DHEAS were approximately twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with women with serum hormones in the bottom quintile . In the same analysis, a doubling of androgen concentration resulted in a 20 to 40% increase in risk for breast cancer.When estradiol and testosterone were included in the same model, the effect of doubling of testosterone on breast cancer risk was greater than that of estradiol , and similar results were observed for androstenedione when combined in a model with estradiol. These androgens may increase cell proliferation by being converted to estradiol and estrone in the circulation or target tissue. In addition, androgens may affect breast cancer risk by directly stimulating the growth and division of breast cells.In the cross-sectional analysis of 443 postmenopausal women in New York, Sweden, and Italy described earlier, increased adiposity was positively associated with bioavailable testosterone , free testosterone, , androstenedione , and DHEAS . In the study of 420 postmenopausal women without cancer in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, BMI, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were positively associated with concentrations of testosterone, although the associations were not statistically significant. The greatest effect of adiposity on testosterone level appeared to be in the women whose BMI was greater than 25.8 vs. lighter weight women. In that same study, concentrations of DHEAS rose slightly but nonstatistically significantly with increasing measures of adiposity .In the Health, Eating, Activity, Lifestyle cohort of breast cancer patients, overweight and obese women had statistically significantly elevated levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHEAS . Levels of DHEAS and free testosterone were higher in women in the top quartiles for body fat mass compared with the leanest women.In the Physical Activity for Total Health Study described earlier, a 1-year moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program produced statistically significant reductions in androgens with fat loss. Among women who lost >2% body fat, testosterone and free testosterone concentrations fell by 10.1 and 12.2% between baseline and 12 months in exercisers comparedwith a decrease of 1.6 and 8.0% in controls . Concentrations of testosterone and free testosterone among exercisers who lost between 0.5 and 2% body fat declined by 4.7 and 10.4%. In controls who lost this amount of body fat, concentrations of testosterone and free testosterone declined by only 2.8 and 4.3% .\n",

Both adiposity measures were statistically significantly negatively associated with concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG, although the associations with free testosterone were weak. The lowest concentrations of testosterone and free testosterone were seen in men whose waist circumference was in the highest tertile and whose BMI was in the lowest tertile, e.g., those with the most disproportionate amount of abdominal adiposity.Among 178 men sampled from the San Antonio Heart Study, free testosterone, but not total testosterone, was inversely associated with central adiposity . In a sample of 511 men in the Rancho Bernardo Study, total testosterone was inversely associated with subsequent central obesity .In another report from the Rancho Bernardo Study in 775 men with and without prediabetes or diabetes, those with BMI ≥ 27 had lower testosterone and bioavailable testosterone . Waist-to-hip ratio showed similar, but attenuated, associations . In a population-based random sample of 1241 middle-aged U.S. men, androstenedione, total plasma testosterone, albumin-bound testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and SHBG decreased with increasing quintile of BMI .

      "Adipose tissue is a significant source of estrogens for women, especially after menopause. These elevations are significant enough to increase risk for several hormone-related cancers, particularly postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers. These associations are seen in healthy women as well as in women with breast cancer. Overweight and obese women also have elevated circulating androgen concentrations. Preliminary evidence suggests that these elevated hormones can be reversed through weight loss, through diet or exercise, although the exact dietary and exercise patterns most likely to limit excess hormone production are not known.

      "An estimated 10 to 40% of cancer cases are attributed to obesity. Excess adipose tissue, a central feature of obesity, increases the release of free fatty acids and certain cytokines, which leads to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Elevated concentrations of insulin result in elevated concentrations of biologically active insulin-like growth factor-1 and, through their respective receptors, both of these factors may contribute to tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation. Fortunately, a few pivotal studies indicate that lifestyle intervention can delay or prevent the onset of tumor growth and metastasis. Reduced caloric intake, adherence to a prudent dietary pattern, and increased physical activity are particularly effective strategies to reverse insulin resistance. Data suggest that implementing these lifestyle intervention strategies may help reduce the risk of chronic disease, including cancer.\n",

      "Obesity is a complex disorder characterized by the accumulation of excess adipose tissue.50 In Western countries, much of the problem stems from eating \"too much of a bad thing.\" Fueling this unfortunate habit is the current trend toward increased portion sizes and the widespread availability of inexpensive convenience or \"fast\" foods, which are often high in fat and calories. Studies suggest that Americans get 30% of their daily calories from junk food51 (now also called \"foods of minimal nutritional value\" 52Lack of adequate exercise is the other central problem. Of American adults, 28% lead sedentary lifestyles53; this is intricately linked to obesity.54 Only one-quarter of Americans meet the current recommendations for physical activity, which call for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate activity a day.5556 Improper nutrition, inadequate physical activity, and the resulting increase in body weight are also the root causes of metabolic syndrome, a major health risk factor that precedes cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.57-59 Having at least three of the following five risk factors qualifies an individual for metabolic syndrome 60:\n",

      "Insulin is a peptide hormone secreted by beta cells of the pancreas in response to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Insulin and the structurally homologous insulin-like growth factors reside as a family of growth hormones.62,63 Insulin controls the movement of glucose into muscle cells and suppresses the liver's production of glucose. It also regulates the breakdown of fat cells in adipose tissue. Therefore, skeletal muscle, the liver, and adipose tissue are the main organs affected by insulin resistance.\n",

      "There is good evidence that overweight and obesity can lead to insulin resistance.64,65 Weight gain leads to an increase in adipose tissue and adipocytes. 66 Adipose tissue serves as a storage depot for energy in the form of triglycerides. The size and metabolic activity of adipocytes vary dependingon their location in the body. Compared to subcutaneous adipocytes, abdominal adipocytes are characterized by enlarged cells that are less sensitive to insulin-mediated antilypolysis, are more sensitive to catecholamine-induced lipolysis, and display increased metabolic activity via this elevated lypolytic activity and the increased release of free fatty acids.67 Because visceral adipocytes uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, many physicians prefer to use abdominal circumference rather than BMI to assess the severity of potential health risks associated with overweight and obesity.\n",

      "Excess adipose tissue results in the increased concentration of serum free fatty acids, partly due to an impaired inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue.66 During normal lipolysis, adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase, activated by glucagon or epinephrine, hydrolyzes triclycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids, increasing the release of free fatty acids into the blood. Insulin exerts the opposite effect of glucagon by inactivating hormone sensitive lipase, inhibiting the mobilization of fat from adipose tissue. Once released into the blood, free fatty acids must be oxidized for energy use; or re-esterified to triglycerides in the liver. Failure of these metabolic pathways will result in elevated serum free fatty acids. This is particularly true for individuals with a genetically based impaired lipoprotein lipase, a condition associated with obesity and insulin resistance.69-72 Elevated serum concentrations of free fatty acids inhibit insulinstimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. 73,74\n",

      "Adipose tissue also harbors a warehouse of cytokines, or signaling hormones, that are key to energy regulation,75 including tumor necrosis factor alpha , resistin, and adiponectin.66 Excess adipose tissue causes an increase in the release of TNF076 and resistin7778 and a decrease in the release of adiponectin. 79,80 These cytokines, particularly TNFox, stimulate the upregulation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. Increased levels of TNFox, derived from increasing numbers of fat cells, particularly in visceral tissue, also increase the release of free fatty acids. This, in turn, increases lipolysis, creating a vicious cycle of more fat cells and more free fatty acids.81 Through these mechanisms, elevated serum levels of free fatty acids, TNFox, and other cytokines impair insulin sensitivity. These elevated serum concentrations of insulin and TNFα also target receptors on cells that promote cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis, leading to tumor development.\n",

      "Because insulin resistance decreases the organs' sensitivity to the actions of insulin, the body compensates by secreting more insulin. Elevated serum concentrations of insulin lead to a state of hyperinsulinemia. Chronic hyperinsulinemia is associated with certain colon,82 breast, 83,84 pancreatic, $5 and endometrial86 cancers. Increased blood levels of insulin cause a reduction in insulin-like growth-factor-binding proteins, resulting in an increase of the metabolically active protein, IGF-1, a molecule that regulates cell proliferation in response to energy from diet and body reserves.11Insulin's tumorigenic effects may be direct, through signaling via the insulin receptor, or indirect, via insulin's influence on IGF-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor , and the steroid hormones.87 Research on certain cancers demonstrates that IGF-1 appears to mediate insulin's ability to promote cell division.88,89 Together, these growth factors promote cell proliferation and inhibit programmed cell death.9091 Through these mechanisms, overweight and obesity lead to insulin resistance, which may promote cancer .FIGURE 20.1 Effects of obesity on growth-factor production. In obesity, increased release from adipose tissue of free fatty acids , tumor necrosis factor α , and resistin, and reduced release of adiponectin lead to the development of insulin resistance and compensatory, chronic hyperinsulinemia. Increased insulin levels, in turn, lead to reduced liver synthesis and blood levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and probably also reduced IGFBP1 synthesis locally in other tissues. Increased fasting levels of insulin in the plasma are generally also associated with reduced levels of IGFBP2 in the blood. This results in increased levels of bioavailable IGF1. Insulin and IGF1 signal through the insulin receptors and IGF1 receptor , respectively, to promote cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in many tissue types. These effects might contribute to tumorigenesis.\n",

Several studies suggest a strong association between breast cancer and insulin resistance; however, more studies are needed to validate a causal relationship.92 Through its negative effect on proper cell functioning, hyperinsulinemia appears to play a role in the etiology of breast cancer. Most breast cancer cells overexpress the insulin receptor93,94 and the IGF-1 receptor,95 that contribute to the pathophysiology of breast cancer.94,96,97 Insulin and IGF-1 regulate cell proliferation via a tyrosine kinase growth factor cascade in breast cancer,88 which may explain evidence of insulin's tumorigenic effects. 88,94,96\n",

      "Obesity is responsible for an estimated 10 to 25% of all breast cancers.98 More than 100 studies have examined the associations between breast cancer risk and weight or BMI, including those looking at weight gain at different ages and location of weight gain . Taken together, the findings suggest that women who are overweight or obese have a 30 to 50% increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer compared with leaner women. 33,99,100 Furthermore, lifetime weight gain in excess of 9.7 BMI points or 20 kg was associated with doubling of the risk of breast cancer.Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, plays a role in the biology of breast cancer by increasing circulating concentrations of androgens, as well as insulin, IGF-I, and other growth factors. Obesity is also associated with steroid hormonal profiles thought to favor breast cancer growth, 101 including higher concentrations of female hormones in postmenopausal women who are estrogen receptor positive and increased risk of breast cancer in women over age 50.Weight also influences breast cancer survival. Women who are overweight, obese, or gain weight after diagnosis have poorer survival from breast cancer compared with women who maintain an appropriate BMI. 101,102 Race is another important factor. Obesity and obesity-related disorders, including breast cancer, are more prevalent in African American women!03,104 than in their white counterparts, a disparity even more pronounced among middle-aged women .105 African American women develop breast cancer an average of 10 years earlier than white women. They also present at a higher stage, with an increased number of positive nodes and more estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative tumors.106 African American women appear to be at greatest risk for weight gain in their second and third decades of life.Metabolic syndrome, in which excess weight is a central feature, is common among minority women. The prevalence among African American women is approximately 57% higher than in African American men. Hispanic women have a prevalence about 26% higher than that of their male counterparts .107 Finally, African American women have poorer outcomes from breast cancer than their white counterparts. These racial disparities in survival may stem from hormonal and genetic differences in African American women that affect their response to breast cancer therapy.106Tall women and those who experienced rapid growth during adolescence may also be at increased risk of developing breast cancer.108 In this respect, height and rate of growth in early life potentially may be added to obesity and race as risk factors for developing breast cancer. Because Americans have become taller and fatter over the last four decades109 and both factors may contribute to breast cancer incidence, increasing numbers of the U.S. population are at risk. Fortunately, a few pivotal studies indicate that lifestyle intervention can delay or prevent the onset of tumor growth and metastasis.\n",

      "The evidence linking breast cancer and dietary fat, particularly saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, was strong enough to warrant intervention through WINS and other studies such as the Women's Health Initiative and the Women's Healthy Eating Lifestyle Study . Launched in 1987, WINS is a National Cancer Institute-funded trial investigating the effect of a low-fat diet on the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with stage I and II disease. Participants were randomized to a diet in which 15% of caloric intake is from fat or to a nonintervention group in which approximately 30% of caloric intake is from fat.110 All had previously received currently recommended treatment with tamoxifen or chemotherapy. The study required accrual of 2500 participants at 30 participating cancer centers. Recent data from the WINS trial suggest that lifestyle intervention resulting in dietary fat intake reduction may improve the relapsefree survival of postmenopausal breast cancer patients.In a recent substudy of the WINS trial, 200 subjects were randomly selected from the low-fat diet arm of WINS to reduce their fat intake even further to examine the successful dietary strategies made by these women. Foods were divided into main groups and subgroups based on the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. The most substantial dietary changes made by the women in the strictly adherent low-fat group included a statistically significant decrease in the number of servings of high-fat foods from the following subgroups: sweet breads, snack foods, cheese, red meats, nuts and seeds, and eggs.112 The strictly adherent group appears to have achieved this reduction in fat intake by shifting the number of overall servings consumed from each food group and significantly decreasing servings from the fats/oils/sweets and the bread food groups112 . Consumption of \"other fruits\" including apples, pears, and bananas increased. Women in the study were able to maintain sufficient nutrient intake while reducing dietary fat.Source: Reprinted from Winters, B.L. et al., J. Am.

      "The WHI is a 15-year exploration of how to prevent coronary heart disease, breast and colon cancer, and fractures from osteoporosis. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the WHI is one of the largest studies of its kind ever undertaken in the U.S. It involves more than 40 centers nationwide and over 162,000 American women aged 50 to 79. Enrollment began in 1993 and ended in 1998. First results of the Dietary Modification Trial are expected in 2006.113The WHI Dietary Modification Trial is less a test of the dietary fat hypothesis than it is of the impact of a low-fat dietary pattern114 high in fruits, vegetables, and grains on disease prevention. The trial involves approximately 49,000 women followed for 8 to 12 years, who followed their usual eating pattern or a diet low in fat but high in fruits, vegetables, and grains. The modified diet reduces daily fat intake to 20% of total calories, boosts fruits and vegetables to five or more daily servings, and increases grains to six or more daily servings. Structured telephone counseling. supported by print materials and monthly cooking classes, provides the principal instrument for maintaining the intervention.To examine the associations among physical activity, diet, and insulin more closely, researchers studied a subsample from the WHI participants - 2996 postmenopausal women with no prior cancer history. Dietary intake was determined with a food frequency questionnaire and physical activity by questionnaire with fasting insulin regressed on physical activity and caloric intake. Figure 20.3 shows the differences in insulin levels in each quintile of physical activity and caloric intake, with approximately 120 values in each subgroup. Controlling for body weight, increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake independently predicted lower insulin concentrations. These results suggest that it is possible to manipulate and lower insulin levels through common weight loss strategies.FIGURE 20.3 Differences in fasting insulin levels as mean values by quintiles of physical activity and caloric intake .

      "An editorial in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute115 highlights the potential inaccuracy of the food frequency questionnaire as an exposure assessment tool in studies associating dietary intake with chronic disease risk. The authors illustrate that nutritional epidemiology involves complex multivariate models, and the measurement error of the instrument could be greatly amplified in this multivariate analysis, confounding associations between dietary intake and disease incidence. This may explain why a protective association between fruit and vegetable intake and cancer incidence was not evident in one study.116 A similar effect was observed in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition Study, when researchers discovered that an association between saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk was being obscured by the measurement error of the FFO.117The WINS trial methodology employs a dietary reporting system of serial, unannounced, 24hour dietary recalls over the telephone. Through careful background research and analysis, this measurement tool was found to be more accurate and reliable than the FFQ. 11,118 Dietary intake was assessed by the mean of three recalls using the multiplepass 24-hour recall system previously shown to be useful in this population.119 Women in the low fat diet arm experienced a 24% reduction in recurrence risk over 5 years compared with controls. 111\n",

      "Compliance with \"prudent\" dietary patterns based on current national guidelines is associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases120-122 and is a crucial step in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke.123 The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans124 feature Institute of Medicine reference intakes for macronutrients125 and nine, easy-to-understand key messages for good health. The thrust of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is away from the Western diet, which is higher in saturated fats, red meat, and refined flours, and toward a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. The latter is classified as a prudent dietary pattern. 126,127In terms of reducing the risk of cancer, the strategy of adhering to a prudent dietary pattern is supported by a study that examined subjects from the Iowa Women's Health Study, suggesting that better compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is linked to a lower risk of cancer.128 Compliance with the \"cluster of nutrition-related behaviors\" recommended by the Dietary Guidelines was associated with a 15% overall reduction in cancer incidence among postmenopausal women in the top quintile of degree of adherence to the guidelines. Those who followed the physical activity, weight control, and diet recommendations cut their risk of cancer by 15%. In so doing, they underscored the power of lifestyle modification to protect middle-aged or older women against cancer.A wealth of research indicates that diets reduced in calories, low in saturated fats, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains offer a safe, effective way to maintain a healthy body weight. !23 Reduced caloric intake, adherence to a prudent dietary pattern, and increased physical activity are particularly effective weight loss strategies for the obese, insulin-resistant individual.123 Weight loss will result in lower insulin129 and IGF-I130 levels, the reversal of insulin resistance,131,132 and, thus, a reduction of the risk of cancer.119,120,133,134\n",

The acquired immune system is capable of recognizing and eliminating specific foreign microorganisms and molecules. Nonspecific immune events result in inflammation and occur in response to an injury or infection; they comprise local and systemic changes. These systemic events, called the acute phase response, are responsible for the release of an array of proteins from the liver called acute phase proteins.2 Classically, the inflammatory response was considered an acute phenomenon designed to limit tissue damage or infection. However, researchers are now focusing on chronic inflammation and inflammatory molecules as playing significant roles in a variety of acute and chronic diseases.\n",

      "Innate and specific immune responses involve a multitude of cells. The primary channel of communication between these cells in both types of responses is through a group of secreted lowmolecular-weight proteins called cytokines. Previously, cytokines were thought to be involved only with immune functions, but it is now believed that some cytokines interact with the immune and endocrine systems and are constitutively expressed. In general, cytokines bind to receptors on target cells and trigger signaling cascades that alter gene expression in the cells. They have high affinity for their receptors that allows a very small concentration of cytokines to have a significant biological effect.3The role of cytokines and other inflammatory markers in the immune response and in the endocrine system is difficult to study for many reasons. Cytokines are pleiotropic in nature. One cytokine, for example IL-6, can have multiple effects on multiple cells. Next, cytokine action is often redundant, with two or more cytokines signaling similar cascades. Cytokines often act synergistically; two or more cytokines can have a greater effect than either can alone. Finally, cytokine signaling depends on the presence and availability of cytokine receptors on the cells. Cytokine receptors are highly specific and are found in cell membranes, where they trigger a signal cascade, and also in the bloodstream, where they serve to down-regulate an immune response by binding up floating cytokines.3Hundreds of cytokines and other inflammatory markers are known and an exhaustive review of each one is beyond the scope of this chapter. Thus, this chapter is limited to well-studied inflammatory markers thought to play a role in obesity and its related comorbidities. A list of commonly studied inflammatory markers, cytokines, and hormones, as well as the type of study in which they were examined, is provided in Table 21.1.\n",

It is one of the major physiological mediators of acute phase reactions. IL-6 is secreted by a number of different cells, including circulating white blood cells, and by adipose tissue - specifically, visceral adipose tissue, which has a greater capacity for IL-6 production than peripheral adipose tissue does. 16,17 Stimulation by sympathetic input is also known to increase circulating IL-6 levels, and B-adrenergic stimulation has been found to increase IL-6 release from adipose tissue.18,19 IL-6 is also involved in the cortisol-stress response , and glucose metabolism.TNF-a is a potent proinflammatory cytokine and historically has been thought to be produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages. However, hypertrophied adipocytes have been shown to produce significant amounts of TNF-α.20-22 TNF-α is a strong stimulator of IL-6 release, which feeds back to inhibit TNF-o production. It has been hypothesized that IL-6 production from adipose tissue is a consequence of TNF-o levels.22\n",

      "A selection of studies that examined the cross-sectional association between markers of inflammation or cytokines and obesity was reviewed.24-52 Among the most commonly studied markers are CRP and IL-6. In a number of recent studies, CRP has been reported to be associated positively with BMI.28,30,31,36,38,39,45,50,51 In a study of 2205 women and 1940 men from the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , significant and independent associations existed between CRP concentrations and both waist circumference and BMI.31 In a sample of 61 obese postmenopausal women, Tchernof et al. found plasma CRP levels were positively associated with body weight, BMI, fat-free mass, total fat mass, and the intra-abdominal adipose tissue area.45Similarly, CRP has been reported to be associated with measures of central adiposity such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and visceral adiposity.24,36,43,50,30,50,50,50,50,50,500,000 Japanese men and women and found CRP to be associated with visceral adiposity even after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking 43 Forouhi et al. compared South Asian and European men and women. In South Asians, waist girth and visceral fat area were highly associated with CRP. In contrast, in Europeans, BMI and percentage body fat were more significantly associated with CRP.33In a study of postmenopausal women from the Healthy Women Study, measures of central adiposity and overall adiposity were all associated with CRP levels. Interestingly, CRP levels increased linearly across quartiles of visceral adipose tissue, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.24Other measures of inflammation, such as IL-6 and TNF-o, have also been examined crosssectionally for association with body composition. In general, the results are similar to those of CRP. IL-6 correlated with measures of obesity in several cross-sectional studies.38,39,44,47,50,52 In a population of 107 healthy men and women, Yudkin et al. found that concentrations of IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α were strongly related to measures of total and central obesity.50 Similarly, TNF-α is associated with obesity in a number of studies. 35,38,50,52Few cohort studies have specifically investigated the development of obesity and changes in inflammatory markers. One study by Duncan et al. studied weight gain and white blood cell count, fibrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factors in the 13,017 men and women aged 45 to 64 in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort. Adjusted odds of a large weight gain for those in the highest quartile of fibrinogen were 1.65 when compared with the lowest quartile. Similar results were found for those in the highest quartile of white blood cell count, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor.54\n",

Trials have used a variety of weight loss interventions, including exercise, diet, and behavioral modifications, as well as surgical procedures such as liposuction and bariatric surgery. Length of follow-up has varied greatly, from 3 weeks55 to 24 months.56 The majority of the trials were nonrandomized trials without control groups.When a negative caloric balance is achieved and weight is lost, regardless of type of weight loss intervention, CRP and IL-6 have consistently been shown to decrease35,9,45,56-66 and TNF-cx has decreased33,39,66-68 or remained unchanged.57,60,61,63,69 Hormones such as leptin and insulin consistently decreased with weight loss. 35,57,58,64-66 One of the largest trials of weight loss consisted of 316 sedentary, older men and women with a follow-up time of 18 months; participants were randomized to a control group or weight loss intervention group. In this study, participants in the diet-induced weight loss group had significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, and soluble TNFR-1 compared to those who had no weight loss treatment.61In a novel study by Klein et al. published in the New England Journal of Medicine, numerous plasma markers of cardiovascular disease risk were assessed in 15 obese females before and after undergoing abdominal liposuction.69 They found no change in CRP, IL-6. TNF-cx, adiponectin, or insulin levels despite an overall reduction in weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Interestingly, subjects with normal glucose tolerance had a larger reduction in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue compared with those with abnormal glucose tolerance . The volume of abdominal visceral adipose tissue and thigh adipose tissue did not change in either of the groups. This study showed that weight loss through a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue is not sufficient to reduce elevated inflammatory parameters in obese women. In addition, it reinforces the current view that visceral adipose tissue is more active than subcutaneous adipose tissue in the secretion of metabolic and inflammatory parameters.\n",

Gender differences in the physical activity-fatness-inflammation relation deserve further research. Current research suggests that systemic inflammation appears to be driven largely by physical activity habits in men , but body weight may be the primary driver in women. The source of the gender difference, if indeed one exists, is subject to speculation. However, potential starting points for investigation include location of fat mass , effect of hormones , and stress.Though not a randomized trial, Milani et al. reported that participation in a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program reduced CRP in individuals with cardiovascular disease compared to no change in a control group of individuals with cardiovascular disease who elected not to participate in cardiac rehabilitation. In the group that attended cardiac rehabilitation, the reduction in CRP was similar in individuals who took statin medications and those who did not, and the reduction in CRP in those that lost weight was similar to that in those who did not .10 Currently, no randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trials exist in the literature that are specifically designed to examine the ability of physical activity to reduce inflammation. With the growing importance of inflammatory markers such as CRP as clinical predictors of morbidity, there is a need for well-designed trials that examine the role of exercise in reducing inflammation in men and women from different ethnicities in a variety of populations.FIGURE 21.2 Adjusted geometric mean CRP values for categories of fitness and fatness. Data adjusted for age, BMI, vitamin use, statin medication use, aspirin use, presence of inflammatory disease, CVD, diabetes, and smoking. The number of individuals in the low fit-normal weight category was insufficient to generate a meaningful analysis. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. P < 0.05 compared to moderate fit; p = 0.01 compared to low fit; p ≤ 0.001 compared to low fit.FIGURE 21.3 Change in mean C-reactive protein for individuals with CVD who completed a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program grouped by weight loss during the program. There were no substantial differences in changes in C-reactive protein between the group that reduced weight and the group that did not.\n",

      "Modern technology has made the measurement of markers of inflammation and cytokines cheap and widely accessible. Many chronic disease conditions are associated with an elevated state of inflammation and, for some conditions, inflammation may be part of the causal pathway. Extensive cross-sectional data demonstrate a strong association between markers of inflammation and measures of body fatness. Furthermore, weight loss intervention studies demonstrate reductions in plasma markers of inflammation with reductions in weight. However, the relative contributions to the development of an elevated state of inflammation of the behaviors responsible for overweight and obesity, such as poor diet and physical inactivity, remain poorly understood. Interventional studies are needed to examine the role of diet, physical activity, and weight loss in reducing inflammation in both genders across a variety of study populations.\n",

      "The prevalence of obesity is increasing at an unprecedented rate , and the occurrence of this disorder in humans is reported to be associated with an increased risk for a number of chronic diseases, including several types of cancer . The goal of this review is to identify mechanisms that may account for the observed relationship between obesity and the occurrence of cancer. The obese state may affect the clinical characteristics of a carcinoma and/or on cancer treatment outcomes ; however, the extrapolation of such effects to understanding how obesity modulates the disease process resulting in cancer may obscure critical relationships and/or generate false leads about candidate mechanisms. Therefore, no consideration will be given to how obesity may affect the characteristics of detected cancers, cancer therapy, or cancer prognosis.Obesitogenesis is a complex disorder resulting from the chronic misregulation of energy balance that results in obesity. Carcinogenesis also is a multifaceted disease process operationally divided into initiation, promotion, and progression; one particular stage of this disease is cancer. Obesitogenesis and carcinogenesis develop over a period of years. Given their complexity and time frame for occurrence, it is not surprising that the investigation of the relationship between obesity and cancer incidence in human populations is laden with difficulties and that the elucidation of causal mechanisms from such studies is even more problematic.Animal models for obesitogenesis and carcinogenesis are well established; thus, a significant opportunity exists for experiments using these models to inform clinical understanding about potential cause and effect relationships between these diseases because key variables difficult to control in human populations can be manipulated using animal models. As will be discussed in subsequent sections, available preclinical evidence fails to support a direct relationship between obesity per se, i.e., body fatness and the occurrence of cancer. This observation illustrates the potential for preclinical studies to inform, challenge, and reshape current understanding about two very complex disorders. This chapter will be narrowly focused in order to advance a mechanistic hypothesis about the linkage between obesity and the occurrence of cancer.\n",

      "Obesity is an operationally defined stage in obesitogenesis characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat . Accumulation of energy in the body is due to an excess intake of energy relative to the amount of energy expended, a condition referred to as positive energy balance. In the adult, a lifestyle characterized by chronic positive energy balance leads to the development of overweight and obesity.In a number of animal studies, models for obesity have been combined with carcinogenesis models to study the effects of obesity on the development of cancer . In those experiments. animals ate excessive amounts of diet, usually as the result of a genetic defect that is a component of the obesity model. Over time, sufficient carcass energy was accumulated and the animals were considered obese. At time points after the obese state was attained, cancer endpoints were measured. The majority of studies in which a cancer endpoint was assessed concluded that a higher incidence of cancer occurred in obese animals.However, in a subset of these studies, an effort was made to determine whether body fatness was the determinant of increased cancer rates; a direct relationship between body fatness and the occurrence of cancer was not found . Consistent with these preclinical data, an expert panel on the role of weight control and physical activity in cancer prevention concluded that adult weight gain in excess of 5 kg, not obesity per se, is associated with an increased risk for cancer . This implies that positive energy balance resulting in weight gain rather than obesity per se is a determinant of risk.\n",

      "Although there is a natural tendency to focus on the relationship between obesity per se and the development of cancer, the designation of the obese state is arbitrary - i.e., an operational definition - and indicates only that a particular magnitude of excess energy accumulation, frequently measured as body weight relative to height, has been attained in a disease process that, in most cases, has been ongoing for many years. Given the lack of evidence that obesity per se is linked mechanistically to the occurrence of cancer, an alternative explanation is that positive energy balance is a causal factor that permits the development of cancer.The effects of different magnitudes of positive energy balance that result in different rates of energy accumulation in the body on the carcinogenic process have been investigated in animal models. However, those experiments, known as studies of caloric restriction, are generally not thought of in this light. Rather, given this nomenclature, the understandable perception is that studies of caloric restriction provide a model for starvation, famine, and/or profound undernutrition. Scientific literature contains examples of experiments in which it can legitimately be argued that this was the case; however, in a body of preclinical data on caloric restriction, experiments havebeen carefully designed so that the magnitude of positive energy balance is altered by regulating the amount of energy ingested while providing animals the same amounts of all other dietary components . Moreover, in some experiments, this approach has been refined by introducing the concept of meal feeding all animals in an experiment . For the purposes of this discussion, studies in which the only variable was the intake of calories and in which animals were meal fed are referred to as studies of dietary energy restriction; those experiments will be the basis for the remainder of this discussion of mechanisms.Because mechanistic studies of dietary energy restriction have been primarily conducted in animal models for breast cancer, this chapter is based on studies of experimentally induced breast cancer. Nonetheless, the mechanisms discussed are likely to be applicable to cancer at organ sites other than the breast because the underlying mechanism responsible for the energy balance-cancer linkage appears unlikely to be driven by effects on the metabolism of sex steroid hormones . Rather, available data indicate that such effects are secondary and may serve to amplify the primary effects of different states of energy balance on chemical mediators that modulate cancer risk, depending on the responsiveness to these hormones of the target tissue of interest.It has been reported that female rats fed 60 to 90% of the number of calories consumed by their counterparts allowed to eat ad libitum for the same number of meals and same duration of time each day do not lose weight. Rather, they are in positive energy balance and grow at a constant, although slower rate, depending on the number of calories consumed per day. Animals in these different states are maintained on different levels of positive energy balance. For this discussion, animals that consume 40% fewer calories than animals fed ad libitum are referred to as having a low positive energy balance. They provide a model to identify and study mechanisms that may be operative in individuals that limit weight gain resulting in the accumulation of body fat by monitoring their caloric intake and balancing it with energy expenditure.On the other hand, animals allowed to eat ad libitum experience a high positive energy balance and provide a model to identify and study mechanisms relevant to the effects of increased energy availability on the carcinogenic process. As summarized in Figure 22.1, candidate mechanisms being reported to account for the effects of different positive energy balance on carcinogenesis are presented in subsequent sections with the goal of identifying how positive energy balance affects the process of tissue size homeostasis, the failure of which is a prerequisite for the development of cancer.\n",

      "Carcinogenesis is characterized by a failure in the regulation of tissue size homeostasis in which a clone of transformed cells achieves growth advantage due to an increased rate of cell proliferation and/or a decreased rate of cell death in comparison to neighboring populations of cells . The development of a carcinoma can be considered a failure of tissue size regulation attributed to the formation, selection, expansion, and progression of clones of transformed cells . In addition, it appears that a co-requisite event in the progression of premalignant clones of cells to those diagnosed as malignant is the induction of vascularization . Evidence is now presented that excessive caloric intake creates a permissive environment in which normal controls to cellular proliferation are abrogated, the checks on cell number accumulation by apoptosis are diminished, and restraints on the vascular system to increase blood supply are relaxed.\n",

      "Rates of cell proliferation are generally low in populations of mammary epithelial cells at low risk for the development of cancer, but during premalignant and malignant stages of this disease process, cell proliferation is markedly increased . In animals maintained on low positive energy balance,FIGURE 22.1 An overview of candidate mechanisms that may be involved in accounting for the effects of obesity on the development of cancer: the cellular processes, systemic factors, and intracellular signaling pathways that may be involved are shown. PEB = positive energy balance; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1.rates of cell proliferation remain low despite the fact that cells harbor the genetic defects requisite for the development of cancer. On the other hand, high positive energy balance is associated with increased rates of cell proliferation . Emerging evidence indicates that low positive energy balance slows progression of cells through the cycle cell by retarding passage at the G1/S checkpoint . Mammary carcinomas that emerge in low positive energy balance-treated rats are only 15% the size of age-matched carcinomas that occur in animals receiving high positive energy balance.When these carcinomas were used to mirror the effects of low positive energy balance on the carcinogenic process, levels of phosphorylated Rb and E2F-1 were observed to be significantly reduced by low positive energy balance . Reductions in CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activity in low positive energy balance carcinomas were likely to account for the observed effects on Rb and E2F-1. Both Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27, and levels of these proteins complexed with CDK2 were significantly elevated in low positive energy balance carcinomas, and levels of cyclin E were reduced. On the other hand, regulation of CDK4 kinase activity by low positive energy balance was likely due to a reduction in cyclin D1 protein as well as increased binding of P16 and P19 to CDK4. The majority of changes induced were reported to be reversed when animals were changed to high positive energy balance.Thus, it appears that high positive energy balance is permissive to increases in levels of cyclin D and E, to lower levels of proteins in the Kip/Cip and p16 families of CKIs; these effects work in concert to promote higher levels of activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. Such changes result in the phosphorylation of the Rb protein and the release of E2F and related transcription factors - all of which support the sustained increase in cell proliferation considered a prerequisite for the development of cancer. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that high positive energy balance, which if unchecked will lead to overweight and obesity, increases cancer risk by perpetuating an environment permissive to the deregulation of the cell cycle that is characteristic of carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Apoptosis is a critical process in the regulation of tissue size and defects in this cell death pathway are a prerequisite for the clinical manifestation of cancer . Available data indicate that low positive energy balance favors the maintenance of constraints on the expansion of cell populations through the upregulation of cellular machinery that facilitates the activation of caspases and the suppression of caspase inhibitors. Low positive energy balance has been reported to induce apoptosis in premalignant and malignant mammary gland pathologies , and the pathway by which cell death was induced has been investigated using the experimental approach reported in Zhu et al. . Using caspase activity assays, it was shown that the activities of caspases 9 and 3 were elevated approximately twofold in carcinomas from low positive energy balance rats compared to carcinomas from animals receiving high positive energy balance; caspase 8 activity was similar in carcinomas from both groups.This finding implies that low positive energy balance induces the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis activation and is consistent with the finding that levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL protein were significantly lower and levels of Bax and Apaf-1 were elevated in carcinomas from low positive energy balance- vs. high positive energy balance-treated animals. Expression levels of transcripts for IAP1, IAP2, X-linked IAP, and survivin - proteins that can block the activity of activated caspases - were also found to be significantly lower in mammary carcinomas from low positive energy balance vs. high positive energy balance animals. Thus, high positive energy balance favors a growth environment that permits the expansion of nontransformed and transformed cell populations within a tissue. Given that high positive energy balance is permissive to suppression of apoptotic pathways and the relaxation of cell cycle restraints observed in transformed cell populations, it is not surprising that the magnitude of positive energy balance has been reported to be proportional to the magnitude of the carcinogenic response .\n",

      "Spatial limitations on the diffusion of nutrients and metabolic wastes between the vascular system and the cells that it supplies impose restraints on the growth of nontransformed and transformed cell populations . Vascular supply to a tissue and its component cells can be induced via the expansion in size of existing blood vessels and/or the formation of new vessels. It has been reported that premalignant mammary pathologies and mammary adenocarcinomas from low positive energy balance- vs. high positive energy balance-maintained animals were assessed for pathologyassociated differences in vascularity. The density of blood vessels associated with premalignant mammary pathologies, as well as the density of blood vessels in immediate proximity to mammary carcinomas, was lower in animals maintained on low positive energy balance vs. high positive energy balance, although positive energy balance had no effect on intratumoral vascular density.However, it remains unclear whether these differences in vascular density were due to differences in concentrations of growth factors required for maintenance or growth of blood vessels or to the inability of endothelial cells to respond to growth factors when low positive energy balance is maintained. Efforts to identify effects of positive energy balance on the expression of an array of genes involved in vascularization were inconclusive, although the evidence suggested involvement of signaling pathways of which VEGF is a component . Based on the effects of positive energy balance on vascular density, it can be inferred that low positive energy balance imposes limitations on the supply of nutrients to and elimination of wastes from developing pathologies; these limitations could exert direct effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in transformed epithelial cell populations undergoing clonal selection and expansion. High positive energy balance appears to relax restraints to vascularization, thereby maintaining an environment conducive to the expansion of cell populations. This effect is consistent with a positive association between energy balance and the risk for cancer.The work presented in preceding sections is consistent with the view that high positive energy balance promotes the development of the cancer phenotype by fostering conditions favorable to the clonal expansion of transformed cell populations. It does this by inducing cells to leave the G, phase of the cell cycle. For cells that enter the cell cycle, high positive energy balance favors cell cycle progression due to its effects on the phosphorylation of Rb and the release of E2F1 from its binding to Rb. Increased phosphorylation of Rb is a consequence of the effects of high positive energy balance on the activity of CDK-4 and CDK-2 per the mechanisms described earlier.In addition, high positive energy balance promotes the maintenance of the cellular antiapoptotic machinery by inducing changes in the metabolism of the Bcl-2 and IAP families of proteins. It is speculated that the effects of high positive energy balance on cell proliferation and apoptosis affect not only the expansion of transformed clones of cells, but also the ability of endothelial cells to respond to growth factors that induce vascular expansion. The coordinated regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and vascularization is responsible for the promotional activity of high positive energy balance.\n",

      "That the activity of three cellular processes is coordinately regulated suggests that a common molecular mechanism is at work; the hypothesis advanced is that these effects are a direct consequence of the effects of positive energy balance on glucose homeostasis . In response to low positive energy balance, glucose availability is reduced, circulating levels of insulin and Insulin-like growth factor-1 are reduced and of glucocorticoids are increased. One outcome of these changes is the limitation within a tissue of intracellular growth and survival factors. If this general hypothesis is valid, then it is important to determine whether the effects on carcinogenesis are due to changes in systemic factors involved in glucose homeostasis or to direct effects of glucose availability on cellular metabolism. Evidence addressing each possibility is reviewed in subsequent sections.\n",

      "Studies in rodents have shown that high positive energy balance accelerates DMBA- and MNUinduced mammary tumorigenesis in proportion to the magnitude of positive energy balance. In those studies, high positive energy balance was associated with higher plasma insulin levels again in proportion to the magnitude of positive energy balance maintained . The relevance of these observations is based in part on reports that the development of DMBA-induced mammary tumors was inhibited by alloxan-induced diabetes and that alloxan- or streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats caused a regression of 60 to 90% of DMBA-induced mammary tumors . Tumor growth was restored and tumor latency reduced upon administration of insulin to diabetic rats.The effects of different positive energy balances that modulate mammary carcinoma development on IGF metabolism have also been investigated. In a number of model systems, low positive energy balance is associated with a decrease in circulating levels of IGF-1. For example, Ruggeri and coworkers reported that positive energy balances that inhibited DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis were associated with reduced circulating levels of insulin and IGF-1, but not IGF-1I. A causal role of IGF-1 in mediating the protective effects of low positive energy balance was hypothesized; in that paradigm, the effects of positive energy balance were hypothesized to be mediated via a change in the availability of IGF-1, which in turn modulated tissue size homeostasis by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing the rate of apoptosis .FIGURE 22.2 Magnitude of positive energy balance is positively associated with cancer incidence in the majority of organ sites investigated using animal models. Associations between positive energy balance and cellular processes and systemic factors that have been reported to influence the carcinogenic process are illustrated.Zhu and coworkers have recently reported that protection against cancer is lost and plasma IGF-1 levels are restored to control values when animals are switched from low positive energy balance to high positive energy balance — also supporting a causal role of IGF-1 in accounting for the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic response. However, in recent work, those investigators found that infusion of recombinant human IGF-1 to low positive energy balancetreated animals failed to mimic the effects on the carcinogenic response of switching animals from low positive energy balance to high positive energy balance. Collectively, these data imply a permissive but not obligatory role of insulin and its related growth factors in accounting for the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic response.\n",

      "Over seven decades ago, classical biochemical studies showed that tumors have altered metabolic profiles and display high rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis . Although these metabolic changes are not the fundamental defects that cause cancer, they may confer a common advantage that allows colonies of transformed cells to expand, survive, and progress to cancer. Consistent with those early biochemical studies, PET tumor imaging using the fluorinated analogue of 2-deoxyglucose on a large number of tumor types has provided substantial documentation of the increased uptake of glucose by malignant cells . This implies that a relationship exists between glucose utilization and the development of cancer .Evidence from recent molecular studies has revealed that several of the multiple genetic alterations that cause tumor development directly affect glycolysis, the cellular response to hypoxia, and the ability of tumor cells to recruit new blood vessels . Oncogene activation and/or changes in tumor suppressor gene function result in alterations in glucose metabolism at an early stage during carcinogenesis. It is likely that these effects are due to the development of oxygen gradients that result in reduced oxygen availability in developing clones of cells and that these changes result in the stabilization of constitutively produced HIF-10. In turn, stabilization of HIF-10 leads to increased transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, glucose transport, and angiogenesis. Induction of enzymes involved in glycolysis results in a progressive dependence on glucose in those emerging clones because of the production of ATP via aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation; to support the increased requirement for glucose, expression of genes involved in glucose transport is also increased.If transformed cells have an increased requirement for glucose but low positive energy balance reduces glucose availability, it is possible that low positive energy balance would decrease cellular energy charge in emerging populations of transformed cells with a consequent activation of AMPK. Available evidence, although limited, indicates that activation of AMPK not only conserves the use of glucose, but also regulates, at least in part, cell cycle transit, cell death, and vascularization via effects on the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins. Candidate targets of AMPK include p53, Akt/PKB, and Raf. As noted earlier, low positive energy balance retards cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition, induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial activation pathway, and has differential effects on blood vessel formation and growth.\n",

The investigation of weight control on the development of cancer requires an understanding of the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic process: suitable preclinical models exist in which to conduct the needed research. Work summarized in this chapter indicates that positive energy balance affects the carcinogenic process by modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue vascularity. It remains to be determined why these cellular processes are modulated by positive energy balance, but the role of glucose homeostasis in mediating the effects of positive energy balance clearly merits investigation.\n",

This chapter discusses the genetic components of obesity - a complex area with more than 430 genes, polymorphisms, and chromosomal regions identified as linked to or associated with obesity in humans . Given the breadth of the available knowledge, we focus on the genetic aspects of obesity that are most likely to be related to cancer and its prevention. First, the genetic contributions to obesity, based on data from twin and family studies, and how genetics and the environment may interact in the development of obesity are discussed. Then, current approaches and their challenges to detect genetic mutations involved in obesity are reviewed and select genes of interest, particularly with respect to cancer, are highlighted. Finally, the importance of genetic variability in the success of lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity and cancer risk is discussed. In the interest of space, review papers rather than original articles are cited whenever possible.\n",

      "Although obesity is controlled in part by environmental and behavioral exposures, strong evidence indicates that genetic factors account for a substantial portion of the variation in human adiposity. Several study designs, including twin, adoption, and family studies, have been used to determine the correlation of obesity measures between different family members and the heritability of obesity, which is the variation in a certain trait e.g., body mass index that is attributable to geneticA detailed review of these study designs, including their advantages and disadvantages, can be found in Maes et al. . These researchers determined pooled correlation estimates for various family member pairs across multiple studies of different designs that included more than 25,000 twin pairs and 50,000 biological and adoptive family members. The correlation for BMI was smallest among genetically unrelated pairs , followed by partially genetically related pairs ; it was highest among monozygotic twins . This is consistent with a role of genetic factors in human obesity. Heritability of BMI also supports the role of genetics, although estimates differ by study design. The highest estimates are from twin studies , the lowest from adoption studies , and midrange estimates are from other family study designs . Several analyses combining multiple study designs with large sample sizes suggest that the heritability for BMI is between 40 and 65% .Weight gain over time also appears to have a genetic component; among male twins, the heritability of adult weight gain over 40 years was 55 to 87% and, among female twins, the heritability of change in BMI over 10 years was 57 to 86% . Several studies have suggested that the heritability of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio is higher among women vs. men , but is similar for African-Americans and Caucasians .

      "Although genetics contributes to overweight and obesity, this factor alone cannot explain the sharp increase in the worldwide prevalence of obesity over the last several decades. The current environment, promoting high caloric intake and low physical activity, is thought to be largely responsible for the recent epidemic. In 1962, Dr. James Neel hypothesized that the human genome evolved under conditions of low food availability and high physical activity requirements . Evolutionary forces favored individuals with genotypes that had an increased survival rate during food shortages, such as those with a genetic propensity for storing fat . Thus, the prevailing genetic characteristics of humans are particularly ill suited for the current environment and cannot accommodate the rapidly changing shift from conditions of low to high energy intake.As such, the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors is critical in understanding and reducing obesity. Several investigators have suggested that the current population is characterized by individuals with differing genetic predispositions to obesity . As the environment changes from favoring low energy intake and high physical activity to high energy intake and low physical activity, individuals with a high genetic predisposition for obesity increase their BMI or fat mass more than those with a low predisposition. Individuals with genetic obesity, often characterized by a single genetic mutation , have a high BMI in both environments. This model is supported by overfeeding studies. Among 12 pairs of identical male twins who participated in an overeating protocol for 100 days, the variability in weight and fat mass gain was three to six times greater between vs. within twin pairs . Several genetic polymorphisms have also been associated with varying responses in overfeeding studies .These data suggest that it is important to consider the environment and genetics in the study of obesity. Future research must focus on the genetic mutations underlying obesity and how these mutations may interact with interventions to reduce obesity .\n",

      "Interest in and knowledge of the genetic influences of obesity have increased dramatically since the cloning of the mouse obese gene in 1994 . Genetic determinants of individual variation in human adiposity are likely to be multiple and interacting; each genetic variant likely has only a small to modest effect. This section reviews monogenic and polygenic obesity disorders and obesity-related genes, highlighting the complexities and challenges involved in the search for susceptibility genes in human adiposity.\n",

      "Recent findings have observed that mutations in rodent genes, which have human homologs, can cause similar phenotypes in humans, underscoring the highly conserved nature of the pathway regulating energy balance . Spontaneous mutations causing obesity in mice have led to the cloning of the ob and db genes and the characterization of their human homolog gene products - leptin and the leptin receptor, respectively. Leptin is an endocrine hormone secreted by adipocytes that communicates information regarding long-term energy stores to the brain via its receptor. Mice carrying the ob or the db mutations are characterized by early onset obesity, hyperphagia, low core body temperature, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to diabetes mellitusFIGURE 23.2 The interaction between genetic predisposition to obesity and the environmental milieu. Hypothetical response of four levels of genetic susceptibility toward obesity to changes in environmental conditions from a low energy intake/high physical activity to a high energy intake/low physical activity environment, in the presence of gene-environment interactions. - - indicates individuals with monogenic obesity ; in both environments these individuals are obese. - ■- indicates individuals who have a high genetic predisposition to obesity; in a low energy intake/high physical activity environment, these individuals may be normal to slightly overweight, but in a high energy intake/low physical activity environment, they become obese. - - - indicates individuals who have a moderate genetic predisposition to obesity and become overweight with an environmental shift toward high energy intake/low physical activity. -●- indicates individuals who are genetically resistant to obesity, so in both environments they are lean. : 401-425; Barsh, G.S. et al., Nature, 2000. 404: 644–651; and Perusse, L. and C. Bouchard, Nutr Rev, 1999. 57: S31–37; discussion $37-368.). The ob mutation results in a lack of leptin production, and the db mutation alters the normal splicing of the leptin receptor gene, creating a premature stop codon; both ultimately lead to decreased leptin signaling .Additional single-gene mutations resulting in obesity-related phenotypes have also been identified in mice, all of which have been linked to relevant mutations in humans or have led to the identification of a genetic pathway in which other genes were mutated. Identified human homolog gene products include growth hormone, insulin-signaling protein, cholecystokinin receptor A, lipin, carboxypeptidase E, attractin, agouti signaling protein, and mahogunin . Knockout and transgenic mouse models suggest that many other additional genes potentially affect the development of obesity-related phenotypes. The study of animal models allows for the identification and understanding of the behavioral, metabolic, and physiological pathways involved in obesity.\n",

      "Monogenic forms of obesity are rare and are usually caused by a single mutation in a key regulatory gene, such as leptin. Pleiotropic obesity syndromes - such as the autosomal dominant syndromes of Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy; the autosomal recessive Alstrom, Cohen, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes; and the Xlinked Wilson-Turner syndrome - also are extremely rare and follow a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. The human obesity gene map has identified over 41 Mendelian syndromes relevant to human obesity. Obesity is a clinical manifestation of such syndromes but is not a dominant feature.Single-gene disorders resulting in obesity appear to be largely independent of environmental factors . Obesity-causing genes that are mutated include: leptin , leptin receptor , pro-opiomelanocortin , melanocortin 4 receptor , and proconvertase . The MC4R gene has at least 42 different mutations associated with obesity, making it the most prevalent genetic cause of obesity identified to date. Elucidating the role of these rare mutations provides valuable insight into the complex physiological process of obesity and the critical genes involved in these processes; however, it cannot address the genetic influences involved in the etiology of polygenic obesity.\n",

      "More than 430 genes, markers, and chromosomal regions have been associated or linked with human obesity phenotypes . The human obesity map reports that over 200 human quantitative trait loci for obesity phenotypes have been identified from genome-wide scans; 35 genomic regions harbor quantitative trait loci replicated among two to five studies . All chromosomes except the Y chromosome have had putative loci identified in obesity-related phenotypes . Over 270 studies have reported positive associations with 90 candidate genes; 15 are supported by at least 5 positive studies . The human obesity gene map website:  provides a detailed description of all investigated genes and quantitative trait loci.This section will focus on a few genes for which positive findings have been replicated in multiple independent study populations or that may be particularly relevant to cancer risk, including ß -- and ß -- adrenergic receptors , hormone-sensitive lipase , tumor necrosis factor alpha , uncoupling protein-1 , leptin and leptin receptor , and perixosome proliferator activator receptor gamma-2 .The adrenergic system is a key regulator of energy balance through the stimulation of thermogenesis and lipid mobilization from fat stores . Several coding and functional mutations have been described in the ß -- ADR gene, yet have been inconsistently associated with obesity . The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the ß .- ADR has not been associated with obesity in meta-analyses ; however, the polymorphism may be important only among women . The Trp64Arg polymorphism may also affect the susceptibility to colon cancer in obese subjects .PPARy-2 is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation . The Pro12Ala functional polymorphism is associated with decreased receptor activity and has been examined in 30 independent studies with a total sample size of 19,136 subjects. Meta-analyses suggest that Ala12 homozygotes have a significantly higher BMI than heterozygotes and Pro12 homozygotes, particularly among overweight individuals . However, the Ala12 allele has also been associated with a modest decreased risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus .UCP-1 is expressed in brown adipose tissue and regulates the combustion of fatty acids. It has an important thermogenic effect by promoting heat production and enhancing energy expenditure . The -3826 A/G promoter polymorphism may influence body weight regulation. Family-based and observational studies have observed associations between the variant allele and an increased gain in fat mass and a higher weight gain in adult life . Weak or null associations between other UCP-1 polymorphisms and obesity phenotypes have also been described .HSL is a lipolysis-regulating protein that plays a critical role in energy homeostatis . A noncoding dinucleotide repeat polymorphism may affect lipolysis regulation -subjects with five CA repeats are markedly resistant to lipolysis in subcutaneous fat cells , possibly leading to increased fat accumulation . Additional polymorphisms in HSL also have been associated with obesity .TNF-a is a cytokine that may modulate insulin sensitivity by inhibiting insulin signaling in fat cells and stimulating lipolysis . Increased levels of the cytokine have been linked to obesity and insulin resistance . A -308 G/A promoter polymorphism increases gene transcription in adipocytes and has been inconsistently associated with hip and waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, BMI, and body fat mass . This promoter polymorphism is also associated with high rates of glucose oxidation in normal weight subjects and high rates of lipid synthesis in overweight subjects, suggesting an interaction between body weight and the functional promoter polymorphism .Leptin and its receptor are involved in the long-term regulation of energy stores in the body, acting primarily in the hypothalamus . Several polymorphisms in the coding region and the 5′ and 3' untranslated regions of the leptin gene have been shown to be associated with leptin secretion, body weight, and BMI . Polymorphisms in the leptin receptor have been inconsistently associated with obesity . Recent evidence suggests that the association between obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may be mediated by leptin and the leptin receptor through their role in the regulation of immune function .\n",

      "In the course of conducting genetic research of obesity, it will be important to identify synergistic relationships between different genetic mutations with respect to obesity . Preliminary studies have suggested that additive and nonadditive genetic effects are important in obesity. In other words, allelic effects of some genetic polymorphisms may be amplified or diminished in the presence or absence of other genetic variants. Exploratory analyses have observed gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in ß -- ADR and UCP-1 with resting metabolic rate and changes in body weight . Similarly polymorphisms in ßx-ADR and PPARy-2 may interact with respect to BMI, insulin, and leptin levels . These findings reinforce the idea that specific polymorphism associations with obesity may be underestimated if only their individual and independent effects are considered. Thus, it is important to understand the underlying physiological pathways involved in obesity to better address possible gene-gene interactions.\n",

      "Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are important in understanding the development of obesity. Of particular relevance to cancer is evidence suggesting that genetic predisposition may be important in the response of overweight and obese individuals to weight loss interventions. Much work has focused on behavioral and environmental barriers to intervention compliance; however less research has examined whether certain genetic mutations are linked with weight and fat loss resistance. An early study of seven identical male twin pairs who participated in twice daily exercise for 93 days reported that weight and fat loss were more similar within vs. between twin pairs . Similarly, a family exercise intervention study reported that changes in waist circumference and abdominal fat measures were more similar within family groups than between families .Several of the polymorphisms, including PPARY-2 and ß 2-ADR, discussed earlier also have been found to modify the effect of diet or exercise interventions on weight and fat loss. Prospective observational studies and intervention trials have been used to look at genetic modification of diet and exercise on BMI, weight, and fat. Multiple studies suggest that the PPARy Pro12Ala polymorphism modifies the effect of dietary fat intake and/or exercise on obesity and weight and other intermediate biomarkers of obesity, such as insulin resistance . This information lends biological credibility to the potential role of this polymorphism in obesity. Some but not all studies also suggest that polymorphisms in the ß -- ADR may slightly modify the effect of weight loss interventions .Two studies have reported that the combined effect of two or three polymorphisms may enhance resistance to weight loss. Phares et al. reported that the combined genetic profile of 08-, D>-, and ß -- ADR polymorphisms and their respective interactions explained over 17% of variability in loss of fat mass and abdominal fat due to exercise among older adults. Another exercise intervention reported that polymorphisms in two different sex hormone metabolizing genes found in adipose tissue were associated with fat loss in older women; women with polymorphisms in both genes had a greater amount of fat loss than those with one or neither polymorphism, after accounting for adherence to the intervention . These data suggest that it is important to understand how genetic predisposition may influence the success of weight loss interventions in the population. Focus on intermediate serum or plasma biomarkers is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying a possible interaction and how to better tailor interventions to individual patients.FIGURE 23.3 Change in body fat measures due to a 1-year exercise intervention among postmenopausal women with no, one, or both polymorphisms in two different sex hormone metabolizing genes. Change in body fat measures during a yearlong exercise intervention in postmenopausal women by genetic profile of the CYP19 repeat and COMT Valine/Methionine polymorphisms. These genes are involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of estrogens, which are involved in adipose tissue regulation. Women with 11 repeats or with the Val/Val genotype lost more fat than women of other genotypes in univariate analyses. The two polymorphisms appear to act synergistically, so women ■ with neither the CYP19 , repeat or the COMT Val/Val polymorphisms had the least amount of fat loss, after adjusting for age, caloric intake, and amount of exercise. Women ■ with the CYP19 , repeat or the COMT Val/Val polymorphism had an intermediate amount of fat loss, and women □ with both polymorphisms had the most fat loss. :972-981.)\n",

      "Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease believed to be the result of an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Family studies suggest that 40 to 65% of the variation in obesity is due to genetic factors. However, it is clear that the recent environmental shift promoting high energy intake and low physical activity contributes to the development of obesity in genetically predisposed individuals. To better understand the genetic components of obesity, research in animal models and individuals with monogenic obesity has provided a fundamental understanding of the physiological pathways involved in regulating adipose tissue and energy intake and expenditure. Focus on polygenic obesity, which is responsible for >95% of obese individuals, has identified few common polymorphisms that modestly affect obesity and likely account for a very small portion of the total variance of human adiposity.Thus, it is important to identify more obesity-related polymorphisms and to better determine how gene-gene interactions are involved in the development of obesity. It is also critical to understand how genetic variability affects the ability of overweight and obese patients to lose weight and fat mass when participating in diet and exercise protocols. Intervention studies that have collected biological specimens from participants will be an invaluable resource in this effort. It is clear that the complex relationships among genes, environment, and behavioral variables on obesityrelated phenotypes complicate the identification of susceptibility genes and create an incredible challenge for scientists investigating the genetics of obesity. However, advances in bioinformatics, the completion of the Human Genome Project, the advent of laboratory high-throughput genotyping techniques, and the introduction of robust analytical tools will allow the search for the identification of genes involved in common human obesity to continue.\n",

      "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for all women and the leading overall cause of cancer death in women between the ages of 40 and 59; the incidence of breast cancer is increasing. Fortunately, due to advances in treatment, women with early stage breast cancer have a high remission rate and even those with more aggressive disease may be afforded many additional years of life. Virtually all breast cancer patients undergo surgery and most receive some form or combination of adjuvant therapy, including radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy.Surgery and adjuvant treatments are associated with side effects that may have a significant impact on a survivor's quality of life during treatment, although recent research indicates that QOL declines may persist into survivorship. A recent follow-up study on health-related QOL in breast cancer survivors reported that women treated with previous adjuvant therapy had a poorer QOL at an average of 6.3 years postdiagnosis compared to women who were not treated with adjuvant therapy . In particular, past chemotherapy was a significant predictor of poorer current QOL. Thus, strategies that maintain or improve QOL from diagnosis into survivorship are important elements of the medical management and lifestyle of women with breast cancer.\n",

      "Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is described and assessed in many ways. Recommendations for QOL assessment in cancer clinical trials include physical, emotional, social, and self-perceptions of functioning . In most settings, QOL is measured qualitatively through selfreport, most often using one of any number of standardized instruments. Several cancer-specific QOL surveys have been developed and are useful when assessing the impact of issues unique to the cancer experience , but may in turn omit more generalized QOL issues to minimize survey length and participant burden. Most QOL instruments attempt to assess the impact of disease and treatment on distinct, yet overlapping, domains of function including: physical, role, emotional and social, as well as a sum or weighted sum of these domains to yield a general QOL index. Because QOL is multidimensional and qualitative, and instruments are somewhat variable, reaching a conclusive evaluation of any strategy aimed at improving OOL, including exercise, can be rather challenging.Including objective and quantifiable measures that may underpin the self-report OOL domains could aid in the evaluation of intervention strategies and could also lend insight as to the mechanism by which the intervention has its effect. Numerous studies have reported on QOL and associated changes in women with breast cancer during as well as following treatment. For the purposes of this chapter, when evaluating the efficacy of exercise to maintain or improve QOL during and after breast cancer treatment, descriptions of outcomes on self-report QOL and outcomes likely associated with QOL will be included.\n",

      "A breast cancer diagnosis can have obvious consequences on psychosocial aspects of QOL. Psychosocial domains of OOL affected by breast cancer and treatment include anxiety, depression, hostility, cognition, reduced social functioning, and body image concerns . Treatment further affects psychosocial and physical aspects of QOL, regardless of the treatment regimen . However, the magnitude and domains of QOL affected vary by treatment type and the accompanying side effects .Surgical side effects often resolve during recovery, though scar tissue and persistent lymphedema can impair upper extremity function on the treated side and psychosocial concerns from mastectomy can persist beyond recovery . Radiation side effects include fatigue, skin changes, lung fibrosis, and nausea. Side effects of chemotherapy tend to be more numerous and debilitating and include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, weakness, cardiovascular declines, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, pain, diarrhea, insomnia, and ovarian failure in premenopausal patients that lead to consequences from abrupt estrogen depletion . Hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or anastrazole has notable side effects, including fatigue, hot flashes, night sweats, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness, vision changes, cognitive changes, and mood disorders depending on the medication. Side effects may contribute to the reduced physical domains of QOL reported by women treated for breast cancer, particularly those on adjuvant therapy .The impact of breast cancer on certain domains of OOL may persist beyond the immediate post-treatment period and into survivorship. Prospective studies following women circa diagnosis through treatment and beyond indicate a persistent decline in domains of OOL up to 6.3 years postdiagnosis . Specifically, using data from the Nurses' Health Study, Michael et al . reported a higher risk of decline in functional health status among women with a breast cancer diagnosis compared to women never diagnosed with breast cancer, though the risks of decline decreased with time since diagnosis. Similarly, a long-term follow-up of women 3 to 6.3 years postdiagnosis reported a persistently lower self-report physical function compared to the general population and a higher risk of decline in physical function during survivorship in women who had a mastectomy and/or were treated with systemic adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy . Psychosocial QOL domains were similar between survivors and cancer-free controls.The impact of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment on OOL may be most pronounced among women who are less healthy at diagnosis or have less social support. In general, younger and older women who have poorer mental and physical health at baseline tend to have poorer psychosocial and functional health into recovery . Furthermore, women who are more socially isolated at diagnosis tend to be at a threefold greater risk of decline in social functioning after treatment and less social support at diagnosis is an independent predictor of lower long-term global QOL .\n",

      "Fatigue is a significant problem in cancer care worth further description because it is a common side effect of all postsurgical treatments. Most cancer patients report fatigue during and after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy; some cite it as a reason for prematurely ending treatment . Studies of breast cancer patients who have completed cancer treatment suggest that persistent fatigue negatively affects quality of life . A comparison of fatigue experienced by women with breast cancer at least 1 year following the completion of treatment noted that patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant experienced significantly greater fatigue than subjects who received only radiotherapy . In a study of exercise in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, a strong inverse relationship was observed between fatigue and OOL .This cycle of fatigue with the related loss of self-esteem and inability to perform activities of daily living or maintain social relationships and employment may have a profound effect on patients' quality of life . The relationship among the negative outcomes of fatigue and quality of life in women with breast cancer is clear. Strategies that reduce fatigue in the short and long term may have profound effects on quality of life.\n",

      "Exercise, in most cases, is a neglected area of the treatment plan for cancer patients. Most health care providers fail to advise patients about exercise and the benefits that can be gained from it , though evidence on physical activity benefits is accumulating and becoming recognized by the oncology community . Inactivity may be the trigger for the marked fatigue, weakness, and declines in functional ability and quality of life experienced by cancer patients and survivors. Exercise improves physical condition and mood state in healthy people and those with a variety of physical diseases such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and rheumatic diseases . Exercise may serve a restorative function and contribute to decreased attentional fatigue by shifting attention from the mundane tasks of daily life to a period of exercise, which stimulates neuromuscular function and produces hemodynamic changes , or it may simply reduce depression and anxiety . Exercise in a group setting may also reduce social isolation - a reported risk factor for QOL decline in women with breast cancer . Thus, physical and psychological benefits from exercise have the potential to reduce fatigue and improve functional status and QOL in women with breast cancer.\n",

      "Due to greater feasibility, cross-sectional reports enjoy larger sample sizes. However, they are limited in the ability to establish cause and effect and most often rely on self-report activity, symptoms, and QOL. Despite these limitations, cross-sectional research can typically survey a broader demographic of the population and can generate hypotheses regarding the benefits of exercise.Cross-sectional studies on breast cancer survivors using surveys and/or one-time physical assessments generally agree that exercise has a positive impact on the lives of breast cancer survivors during treatment. A retrospective survey of 71 early breast cancer survivors found that women who exercised throughout their treatment reported an increased quality of life . A secondary analysis of data from a survey of physically active cancer patients to identify the most common symptoms experienced by women with breast cancer revealed that 45% of the sample returned to exercise within 24 hours after treatment, with no reported adverse effects . The most frequently cited treatment-related symptoms improved with exercise were fatigue, general weakness, nausea, depression, and muscular weakness. A survey of 219 athletic cancer survivors' activity patterns demonstrated that patients with all types of cancer continue to exercise during treatment, albeit with reductions in the intensity and duration .The majority of cross-sectional surveys of activity and QOL in breast cancer survivors are in those who completed treatment; most lend additional support for exercise benefits. Six of eight reports of post-treatment exercise participation detected significant differences in QOL and fatigue between survivors who exercised and those who did not. Sample sizes in these studies ranged from 54 to 119 and surveyed women undergoing various treatments. Exercisers reported better selfesteem , vigor , coping behavior , physical competence , body image , and general quality of life and less confusion, distress, fatigue, depression, and mood disturbances compared to nonexercising peers.Only two of eight studies showed no differences between exercising and nonexercising survivors on measures of locus of control and psychosocial adjustment to cancer in 500 women who received various treatments and in 54 women treated with surgery only . It should be noted that neither of these studies surveyed physical QOL domains or fatigue and thus they do not necessarily refute the positive effects cited in other reports.Overall, cross-sectional surveys report a positive association among exercise, QOL and related psychosocial and physical factors, and fatigue. These studies cannot establish causality and include no objective measures of exercise or fitness. However, the consistency of findings generates sufficient reason to believe that exercise is feasible and beneficial for women with breast cancer during and following treatment and lends strong rationale for exercise intervention.\n",

      "Quasiexperimental one-group pre-post test and observational exercise studies provide stronger evidence for exercise benefits, but are less generalizable and methodologically rigorous than randomized controlled trials. A limited number of studies have been conducted in women during and after treatment completion. In a study of exercise in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, all women were prescribed an 8-week program of home-based, self-paced aerobic exercise. In this study, subjects who adopted the exercise program experienced less fatigue and a higher quality of life .Regression analyses showed that reductions in fatigue most likely mediated the positive effect of exercise on QOL . Moreover, women who exercised longer experienced greater reductions in fatigue and the fatigue-reducing effect of exercise persisted for the next 24 hours, suggesting dose-response and carry-over effects of exercise on fatigue . A 16-week structured, supervised, multimodal exercise program also improved fitness and OOL among 45 women treated for primary breast cancer .Studies in breast cancer survivors post-treatment are mixed, but are also less methodologically rigorous because half observed exercise responses to intact community-based or self-reported exercise vs. an experimental program. Pinto et al. followed exercise levels over 12 months in 69 women who had recently completed treatment for early stage breast cancer. Though averageexercise participation did not change over time and was below recommended levels for health, exercising was associated with improved physical function. Exercise was not associated with overall mood or cancer-related symptoms.Twenty breast cancer survivors who volunteered to train for dragon-boat racing were followed over a 6-month period that included 2 months of aerobic and upper body strength training followed by 4 months of competition. Only lymphedema was monitored and was neither exacerbated nor improved by exercise . A small study of ten breast cancer survivors participating in an 8-week multimodal, low-moderate-intensity program reported a trend toward fatigue reduction and improved quality of life and no effect on lymphedema . Peters et al. reported improved satisfaction with life among 24 early breast cancer survivors participating in a 7-month program that was initially supervised then turned to self-directed, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry.Quasiexperimental and observation studies of exercise in breast cancer lend modest support for exercise benefits on QOL improvement and fatigue reduction. Studies in women undergoing active treatment reported positive effects on QOL and fatigue. Post-treatment studies struggled to find a significant effect of exercise on QOL and fatigue , but were generally of limited design. Randomized controlled trials will provide the strongest evidence for exercise benefits.\n",

      "True randomized controlled trials are more challenging to execute, but provide the strongest evidence for exercise benefits. Several exercise RCTs have been conducted in breast cancer survivors in active treatment or post-treatment.Randomized controlled exercise trials have been conducted in women undergoing active treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. Only one study focused strictly on women with early stage breast cancer receiving radiation therapy . Subjects randomized to the 6-week home-based, self-paced walking program experienced fewer and less intense symptoms, less fatigue, and improved functional ability measured by 12-minute walk. The same research group attempted a similar RCT in women undergoing active chemo- or radiation therapy, but had some problems with exercise compliance and contamination when 50% of the control group self-initiated walking exercise . Participants were recategorized as walkers or nonwalkers and data reanalyzed. Women who walked reported less fatigue, less decline in physical function, and increased functional ability, quality of life, vigor, and mood.Most RCTs in actively treated women were in those undergoing chemotherapy for early stage disease. Two of the first studies examined the effects of supervised moderate-intensity cycle ergometry exercise. MacVicar and colleagues demonstrated a 40% increase in functional capacity among women with stage II breast cancer receiving chemotherapy without steroids. No such changes were observed in the control or placebo groups. Exercising subjects increased their exercise time and intensity, demonstrating a training effect that may improve patients' QOL and ability for self-care. In a separate report, the same exercise program was found to attenuate weight gain and body fat increases compared to inactive controls .These studies were among the first to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of an ambitious exercise intervention in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Later, Mock and colleagues combined a home-based, self-paced walking program and support group intervention for women with breast cancer. Subjects in the intervention group reported increased exercise time, less fatigue, less nausea, less depression, and lower emotional distress than subjects in the control group. However, it is impossible to determine which intervention affected specific outcomes.Perhaps the most ambitious study to date in actively treated women was conducted by Segal and colleagues , who studied the effects of 26 weeks of walking exercise on QQL and aerobic capacity in 124 women treated with radiation or chemotherapy for early stage disease. Women were randomly assigned to a usual care group or to one of two exercise groups that performed thesame low-moderate intensity walking program in a supervised or self-directed setting. Women in the self-directed group reported improved physical function compared to declines reported by the usual care group. The supervised exercise group reported a slight increase in physical function that was not significantly different from controls.The authors speculate that chemotherapy may have moderated the failure of the supervised group to improve because separate group comparisons among women not on chemotherapy showed trends for an exercise effect in supervised participants. Exercise did not affect other QOL domains or aerobic capacity in self-directed or supervised groups, suggesting that improved physical function may occur in the absence of measurable fitness improvements. This study was the largest RCT thus far; it suggests that home-based exercise has a beneficial effect on QOL in women undergoing treatment and that chemotherapy may moderate the effectiveness of group exercise.A similar number of RCTs have been conducted in women who were, on average, 3 years posttreatment completion, usually on small samples. A cross-over design to test the effects of 10 weeks of supervised moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on psychological factors in breast cancer survivors found that exercise significantly reduced depression and anxiety but not self-esteem . Similarly, breast cancer survivors randomly assigned to a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise program reported improved body image and less emotional distress compared to wait-list controls .McKenzie et al. conducted a small RCT in women with early stage disease and posttreatment lymphedema . Women performed upper extremity light-intensity resistance and arm ergometry exercise for 8 weeks. No changes in arm volume or circumference occurred, indicating neither a positive or negative effect of exercise on lymphedema. Exercisers reported improved physical function, general health, and vitality compared to decreases reported by controls, but group differences were not statistically different. A small study that focused on physical performance and immune cell function reported that 8 weeks of supervised aerobic plus resistance exercise modestly improved aerobic performance and leg strength, but had no effect on immune factors. Improvements in physical performance are likely to improve physical functioning, though this was not specifically investigated.To date, the largest exercise trial in long-term survivors was conducted in 53 postmenopausal women who completed treatment for early stage disease; some were on hormone therapy . Women were randomly assigned to usual care or supervised moderate-intensity cycle ergometry exercise three times/weeks. Exercisers significantly improved their aerobic capacity, quality of life, happiness, self-esteem, and physical well-being, and lowered fatigue compared to usual care. Body weight and body composition were unaffected.Results from RCTs provide promising evidence for the feasibility and beneficial effects of exercise in women currently treated or who have completed treatment for breast cancer. Importantly, these trials have established that exercise, even of moderate intensity, is tolerable during treatment and can attenuate treatment-related symptoms, particularly fatigue, physical changes, and QOL declines. Though sample sizes tended to be small, significant effects of exercise were detected. A handful of studies in women who completed treatment suggest that exercise is beneficial into survivorship. Because physical function may not fully recover following treatment , it is important to establish that long-term survivors can improve physical functioning and physical performance well after their treatment has ended - perhaps to prediagnosis levels, though this hypothesis has not been specifically studied.\n",

      "In general, exercise studies of varying design support the hypothesis that exercise can improve quality of life and associated physical and psychosocial factors and can lower fatigue. Crosssectional and quasiexperimental studies are mostly in support of this hypothesis, although a few, limited studies failed to establish a positive effect of exercise training. Randomized controlled trialsare relatively few in number and are difficult to compare due to differences in exercise protocols and samples. However, all showed some evidence for exercise benefits and, importantly, these studies determined that exercise is feasible for and acceptable by most women during and after treatment and that women in active treatment for breast cancer can adapt to exercise similarly to the general population.The ability to improve functional ability and quality of life of women during and after treatment has tremendous personal and societal impact. Women are surviving breast cancer in record numbers, in part due to more aggressive treatment that can compromise QQL. As discussed, exercise is a low-cost, broadly effective approach that can maintain or improve QOL for women during treatment and for those likely to lead many productive years post-treatment. Furthermore, the utility of exercise may even prove to have economic implications in that patients who maintain function may be able to continue to work and may remain functionally independent longer than their counterparts who may be experiencing more limits in functional ability due to conditions associated with inactivity and disuse.Limitations of the current research are important to mention. Relatively few RCTs were conducted and most were on relatively small samples. Despite the small sample sizes, significant benefits of exercise were detected, though the largest trial in actively treated women failed to detect a significant benefit of exercise in women participating in a supervised program compared to selfdirected exercise. In contrast, most studies of home-based or supervised programs suggest either setting can be effective. Most interventions were of limited duration, so long-term effectiveness of exercise training on QOL and fatigue in breast cancer survivors is unknown.Currently, a specific exercise prescription for improving OOL and reducing fatigue in breast cancer survivors cannot be derived from this literature. Most studies followed the general recommendations for reducing mortality and morbidity from chronic disease for 30 minutes of moderateintensity activity most days of the week and used aerobic exercise as the sole or central mode of exercise ; they show that this public health prescription benefits women with breast cancer. However, it is not clear what minimal or optimal effective dose of exercise significantly improves QOL and reduces fatigue.\n",

      "The current literature on exercise effects on QOL and fatigue in breast cancer survivors is promising and has generated exciting avenues for further study. Future studies need to be of longer duration, or participants who continue to exercise after trials are completed should be followed so that it can be determined whether women will adhere to exercise long term. Because exercise benefits are known to reverse when training is discontinued , the types of programs and approaches that promote long-term adherence must be explored. Likewise, because the most feasible setting to promote long-term adherence may be community or home-based programs , further and more rigorous study of these settings is warranted.Additionally, the minimal or optimal effective exercise prescription cannot be determined from current studies. None compared varying doses of exercise intensity , time or frequency or compared different modes of activity . Only direct comparisons within a particular sample can determine the minimum amount of exercise necessary to produce significant benefits, whether more exercise produces greater benefits, and whether different modes of exercise are equally effective or have specific benefits.It is also important to attempt to address the mechanisms through which exercise affects QOL and fatigue. One study suggests that physical fitness improvements may not underpin QOL and symptom improvement . Because women more socially isolated and in poorer health at diagnosis are more likely to experience declines in OOL and physical health through treatment and beyond and are less likely to exercise, it would also behoove the research community to developinterventions that could be employed in these populations and later implemented in the community. The current research has led to recommendations to include exercise as part of the long-term treatment plan for breast cancer patients . Excitingly, important work is yet to be done in order to develop effective exercise prescriptions and programs sustainable long term and accessible by all.\n",

      "This chapter summarizes evidence regarding the effects of exercise on quality of life in survivors of cancers other than breast cancer. It begins by providing a brief overview of the incidence and survival rates for the most common nonbreast cancers and then briefly reviews the major medical treatments for these cancers and discusses their implications for QOL. Next, the concept of QOL and how it has been defined and measured in the cancer field is examined. After that, the published research on exercise and QOL in nonbreast cancer survivors is summarized. For this purpose, the literature review is divided into studies that included: mixed site cancer survivors and single site cancer survivors . Then, the two largest randomized controlled trials conducted in single site cancer survivors are reviewed. Finally, future research directions are discussed. Parenthetically, throughout this chapter, the term \"cancer survivor\" is used - as suggested by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship - to refer to any individual diagnosed with cancer, from the time of discovery and for the balance of life.\n",

      "Although breast cancer is by far the most common cancer diagnosed in American women, it still accounts for only about one third of cancers in this population . The obvious converse of this fact is that nonbreast cancers account for about two thirds of all cancers diagnosed in American women . After breast cancer, the most common cancers in American women are lung, colorectal, uterine corpus , ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and skin melanoma . These six cancers account for about 40% of all the cancers diagnosed in American women and about 60% of all the nonbreast cancers. For American men, the most common cancers are prostate, lung, colorectal, urinary bladder, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma . These six cancers account for over 70% of all the cancers diagnosed in American men .Many of the most common cancers in men and women have good survival rates. For example, prostate, colorectal, urinary bladder, skin melanoma, uterine corpus, and ovarian cancers all have 5-year relative survival rates of over 90% if they are detected early . The high incidence rates and good survival rates for nonbreast cancers have resulted in over 7 million Americans who are survivors of these cancers.\n",

      "Although the prognosis for surviving many of the most common cancers is very good, medical treatments are usually needed. The most common treatments for cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy such as chemotherapy, endocrine or hormone therapy, and biological or immunotherapy. These medical interventions reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival, but they can also negatively affect QOL. For example, depending on the location and extent of the operation, surgery can result in significant morbidities such as wound complications, infections, loss of function, decreased range of motion, diarrhea, dyspnea, pain, numbness, lymphedema, fatigue, and anxiety . Similarly, depending on the dose and the site that is irradiated, radiation therapy can cause acute toxicities and late effects, including pain, blistering, reduced elasticity, decreased range of motion, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, diarrhea, lung fibrosis, and cardiomyopathy .\n",

      "Chemotherapy may cause significant side effects including fatigue, anorexia, nausea, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathies, ataxia, alopecia, and cardiotoxicity . The incidence and severity of these side effects depends on the types of drugs, mechanisms of action, drug dosage, administration schedule, presence of other comorbidities, and the use of supportive care interventions . The side effects from chemotherapy can appear immediately, within a few weeks or months, or even years after treatment has been completed . Hormone therapy can have significant side effects, such as weight gain, muscle loss, proximal muscle weakness, fat accumulation in the trunk and face, osteoporosis, fatigue, hot flashes, and increased susceptibility to infection. Finally, although biological therapies tend to be better tolerated than chemotherapy, they can still produce flu-like symptoms that can be quite severe .For many cancers, multimodal treatment is the standard of care. The timing and sequence of the multimodal treatments vary, depending on many factors including the type of cancer and its stage. It is possible, however, that some cancer survivors may be treated on multiple occasions with multiple modalities, concurrently or sequentially, for many months or years. Consequently, it is easy to see that such prolonged and intensive medical treatments may take a heavy toll on the QOL of cancer survivors.\n",

      "The concept of QOL is very important to cancer survivors. Gains made in survival from medical treatments must be judged against any potential decrements in OOL. In fact, QOL has become a standard endpoint in clinical trials of cancer survivors and in cancer care practice . Perhaps not surprisingly, OOL is a difficult concept to define. Farquhar has noted that most definitions can be categorized as global definitions or component definitions. Global definitions focus on overall happiness and satisfaction with life without making reference to any particular component of life. Component definitions, on the other hand, break down OOL into a series of component parts thought to be essential to OOL; most cancer researchers have adopted this latter definition . Although no consensus has been reached on the number and nature of QOL components relevant for cancer survivors, the most commonly mentioned components include physical, functional,emotional, cogmitive, spiritual, and social. Farquhar has noted that such component definitions most likely contribute to the global evaluations of QOL.Despite the difficulties in defining QOL, there is good agreement that it is personal and subjective . Consequently, QOL is primarily measured by self-report. Some cancer researchers have used generic QOL measures such as the Short Form 36 Health Survey , but most have used one of the cancer-specific QOL measures, such as the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System , the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire , the Functional Living Index - Cancer , and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale . These scales assess multiple components of QOL such as physical, functional, and emotional well-being, using items relevant to cancer survivors.\n",

      "Table 25.6 lists the 12 studies located that examined exercise and OOL in single site cancer survivors. Five studies were observational and seven were interventions. Of the five observational studies, three were retrospective, one was prospective, and one was cross-sectional. Of the seven intervention studies, four were randomized controlled trials and three were uncontrolled trials. A total of 1446 participants were involved in the studies, including 1129 participants in the observational studies and 317 in the intervention studies . The cancer sites examined in these studies included three colorectal, two prostate, two multiple myeloma, and one each for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute leukemia, skin melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, and head and neck.The five observational studies measured exercise with self-report scales. The three retrospective studies had cancer survivors recall exercise at three time points: prediagnosis, during treatment, and post-treatment. The prospective study obtained reports of exercise for 4 months after surgery and the cross-sectional study obtained current exercise for cancer survivors after completion of various treatments. Of the seven intervention studies, four initiated the exercise program during treatment, two after treatment, and one included survivors during and after treatment.Four of the intervention studies consisted of supervised exercise and three examined homebased exercise. Exercise frequency was reported as three sessions per week , three to five sessions per week , or four sessions per week . Four of the intervention programs consisted of aerobic exercise, two involved resistance training, and one combined aerobic and resistance exercise. In the four aerobic exercise interventions, the exercise modality was chosen by the participants in two studies, not specified in one study, and consisted of walking or another preferred activity in one study. The prescribed exercise intensities consisted of 85% of measured heart rate maximum , 65 to 75% of measured heart rate maximum , 65 to 80% of measured heart rate maximum , or was self-selected by the participants . Durations of aerobic exercise sessions were 15 to 30 minutes , 20 to 30 minutes , 30 minutes , and 40 to 60 minutes ,The resistance exercise studies consisted of total body exercises involving major muscle groups in one study and upper body exercises designed to enhance scapular stability and restoring/mainBLE 25.5FIGURE 25.1 Borderline significant interaction between experimental group and cancer site on sum of skinfolds from the GROUP-HOPE Trial.

First, only 4 of the 13 studies were randomized controlled trials. Second, the methodology of most studies was not well described . Third, the sample sizes in the intervention studies were very small, with two exceptions . Fourth, follow-up of participants was limited. Here, a more detailed review of the two largest exercise trials in single site cancer survivors other than breast is provided.In the largest randomized controlled trial to date, Segal et al. examined the effects of supervised resistance exercise training on muscular fitness and QOL in prostate cancer survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy . Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group. The exercise group performed nine resistance exercises three times per week at 60 to 70% of one repetition maximum for a 12-week period. The primary endpoints were fatigue and QOL and the secondary endpoints were upper- and lower-body muscular strength .The researchers reported a 13% loss to follow-up and a 79% adherence rate among all participants randomized to the exercise arm . Intention to treat analyses using \"last observation carried-forward\" for missing data showed statistically significant differences in change scores favoring the exercise group for fatigue, QOL, and upper- and lower-body muscular fitness. The fatigue change was 3.0 points and the QOL change was 5.3 points, both of which may be considered clinically meaningful changes for the particular self-report scales that were used. In terms of muscular strength, the exercise group increased upper-body strength by 41% and lowerbody strength by 32% compared to the control group's decline in these measures by 8 and 4%, respectively. Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that these favorable effects were present for men who were treated with palliative vs. curative intent and for men who had been treated with the therapy for shorter vs. longer than 1 year.Courneya et al. examined the effects of a home-based exercise program on QOL in colorectal cancer survivors who had recently completed surgery . About 55% of participants were receiving adjuvant therapy at the time of the exercise intervention. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to an exercise or control group. The exercise group was asked to exercise on their own three to five times per week for 16 weeks at a moderate intensity for at least 20 to 30 minutes each time. The primary endpoints were QOL and cardiovascular fitness .The authors reported a 9% loss to follow-up and a 76% adherence rate among those who completed the trial . The authors also reported that 52% of the control group reported regular exercise. Intention to treat analyses on those who had completed the trial showed no statistically significant differences between the two arms. In an \"as treated\" ancillary analyses, the authors reported that participants who increased their fitness over the course of the intervention had more favorable changes in anxiety, depression, overall QOL, and satisfaction with life compared to those whose fitness decreased over the course of the intervention. The QOL change score difference was 6.5 points, which may be considered clinically meaningful for the self-report scale that was used.\n",

      "Overall, the results of 26 studies to date suggest that exercise may improve QOL in survivors of nonbreast cancers. Several biopsychosocial mechanisms may explain the QOL improvements in cancer survivors that result from exercise training. Courneya has proposed a simple organizational model on how exercise might enhance QOL during cancer treatment . First, exercise may alter one of the many hypothesized biopsychosocial mechanisms thought to underlie improved coping and adjustment to cancer . In turn, changes in these biopsychosocial mechanisms may alleviate or prevent the occurrence of many of the common symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and its treatments . Amelioration of these effects may then reduce their impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living, leisure activities, interactions with others, and so on. Finally, enhanced physical and social activities may improve psychological distress/well-being thereby improving overall QOL. No studies have examined the potential mechanisms of change for exercise and QOL in nonbreast cancer survivors.\n",

      "Although physical activity has been consistently shown to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and breast , little is known about whether physical activity also influences cancer recurrence or mortality. Much of the previous research among cancer survivors has successfully identified many clinical factors, such as treatment modalities and tumor characteristics, that enhance survival. However, given that modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity decrease the risk of cancer development, it is plausible that these factors could also have a favorable impact on cancer prognosis. Most research addressing physical activity among cancer survivors, however, has focused on exercise as a means to improve quality of life issues during and following cancer treatment .Long-term survival rates for cancer patients have largely improved over the past 20 years due to advanced approaches in early detection techniques and adjuvant treatment . More than 9 million cancer survivors currently live in the U.S. , and survivors are quite interested in identifying behaviors that they can undertake in an effort to alter the course of their disease. Recreational activity is a prime candidate to consider because of the opportunity for behavioral modification and the many noncancer health benefits of exercise. Identifying any beneficial prognostic effects of exercise on cancer survival might allow for recommendations to be made regarding its use as a clinical prognostic indicator and provide a basis for intervention strategies aimed at helping cancer patients make lifestyle changes to improve prognosis. Interventions among survivors are under way to promote increased physical activity to test the effect of activity on general well-being or alleviate treatment-related symptoms , but little is known of whether it can actually help to reduce a person's chance of dying.Factors such as physical activity that play a role in preventing cancer occurrence could also affect subsequent survival. The biological mechanisms suspected to mediate the relationship between physical activity and cancer development may continue to influence prognosis. Regular moderate activity has been hypothesized to affect cancer onset by altering endogenous sex hormones , prostaglandins , immune function, insulin or insulin-like growth factors , and body weight .Few studies have investigated the various physiological responses of exercise among cancer survivors to gain further understanding of potential mechanisms related to recurrence, the presence of metastases, or mortality. The effect of exercise on hormone changes has been examined in one small pilot study of breast cancer survivors in which a slight, nonsignificant decrease in hormone levels associated with activity was reported . One randomized controlled trial addressed exercise training on changes in insulin, insulin resistance, IGF, and IGF-binding protein among post-treatment breast cancer survivors . In this study, exercise had sigmificant physiological effects on IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and the IGF-IFGBP-3 molar ratio, but no difference was observed between the treatment and control groups for fasting insulin, glucose, insulin resistance, IGF-II, or IGFBP-1.Several interventions conducted among breast cancer patients have shown physical activity programs to result in weight loss . Among cancer survivors, the potential mechanism most studied in relation to exercise is immune function. A recent review of six small experimental studies of activity during or after treatment found that four studies reported statistically significant improvements in cancer-related immune system function . Although literature regarding the physiological response to exercise among survivors is beginning to emerge, it is still unclear how and whether any of these changes relate to cancer survival because none of the studies described earlier included cancer recurrence or mortality as an outcome.\n",

      "A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify epidemiological studies that examined recreational or occupational physical activity in relation to cancer survivorship, excluding those focused on quality of life issues. A computerized search of English language publications up to June 2004 was conducted using the PubMed online database as well as manual searches of abstract lists for recent cancer or epidemiology conferences and the reference lists of all relevant articles. This search revealed pertinent articles for three distinct areas of research.In this chapter, studies evaluating the relationship between physical activity and survival endpoints among cohorts of cancer survivors are reviewed. Next, studies addressing the association between physical activity and the risk of cancer mortality among apparently healthy noncancer cohorts are discussed. Finally, studies of physical activity prevalence in cancer survivors are examined to understand the effects of a cancer diagnosis on exercise patterns. No studies were found that explored whether cancer prognosis was associated with occupational physical activity.\n",

      "Table 26.1 outlines three studies that examined the effect of physical activity on survival within cohorts of cancer survivors. All three studies were limited to examining the effects of recreational exercise among breast cancer survivors. Two recent reports based on large numbers of women with breast cancer - one using data from population-based cohort studies in New Jersey and Atlanta and the other from the Nurse's Health Study - provide evidence for a reduced risk of death associated with higher levels of activity. In contrast, the smallest study, based on data from a population-based study in412 5-7 1 = 3200 - 54 = 1.42 21 = 3200 - 1.42 (93 1 = 3200 - 1.42 = 0.73 = 0.73 1 = 0.38 - 2.08 (95% ( east cancer mortali cal/week Australia, found no association . The effect estimates were adjusted for different factors in each study, but each controlled for tumor stage or for size; this is important because mortality rates differ significantly by stage of disease .There were some important differences among these studies that could explain in part the lack of consistency between these results. Accurately and comprehensively assessing physical activity levels is a challenge in epidemiological studies. As is often the case, the methods of measuring activity varied tremendously. The assessment tools used in each study included different types of activities and none took into account all three of the important components of activity , which is considered critical for a comprehensive assessment. The timing of the physical activity measurement should also be taken into consideration because important time periods of physical activity may enhance survival, although no specific critical time period has yet been identified. Two studies measured recreational activity in the year prior to diagnosis and reported conflicting results; the other evaluated the effect of exercise at least 2 years following diagnosis and reported a decrease in mortality. Thus, it remains unclear whether the timing of the physical activity is critical in influencing survival.Mortality rates varied among these three survivorship studies from as low as 10% to a high of 27% . This variation could be due to differences in the outcome , distribution of disease stage, and the amount of follow-up time since diagnosis, which ranged from 5 to 16 years. The study populations also varied considerably with respect to age at diagnosis, geographic location, and year of diagnosis; these factors could affect results if mortality or physical activity level is related to any of them. For instance, the average 5year survival was 78% overall for women diagnosed during 1983 to 1985 compared with 87% for those diagnosed later in 1992 to 1999 .It is inappropriate to draw any strong conclusions regarding the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer survival, given the limited number of studies. However, the two most recently reported studies are very promising. This points to a great need for further research among breast cancer survivors, as well as survivors of other cancers, among whom no studies have been conducted.\n",

      "Table 26.2 lists the epidemiological cohort studies investigating the relationship between recreational physical activity and risk of all-cancer or cancer-specific mortality among adults who were free of cancer at study entry. In each of these cohorts, healthy adults were assessed for physical activity at the time of enrollment and followed for assorted lengths of time to assess cancer-related deaths. Studies with all-cause mortality as the end-point were excluded because, among noncancer survivors, a large portion of those deaths are assumed to be attributable to cardiovascular or other noncancer diseases.Interpretation of the results found in the studies shown in Table 26.2 is difficult. In cohort studies in which the outcome under study is mortality and cancer incidence is not assessed, the results are clouded. Because it is known that physical activity reduces the incidence of several of the most common cancers , any association noted with cancer mortality in these studies may simply reflect the association between activity and the development of cancer. Alternatively, these results could indicate that exercise reduces the incidence and mortality of all but the most severe cases of cancer.Despite the ambiguity in interpreting them, the cohort studies shown in Table 26.2 may be informative, given the few available studies of exercise and prognosis among cohorts comprised entirely of cancer survivors. The results from these general population studies are mixed. With respect to all-cancer mortality, three investigations reported a statistically significant inverse rela-7496 (1978–1 ysical activity leve gh, medium, or low equency of regular alking or cycling or cycling of experiently ge, systolic bloc moking, social moking, social lass, alcohol ustionship between activity level and risk of cancer death , four others found an inverse association that was not statistically significant , and no association was observed for the remaining six studies . The majority of these studies were able to control for potential confounding factors. However, it is possible that assessment of these factors may have been inadequate if these changed over the course of the follow-up period.Few studies examined the relationship between physical activity and risk of death from specific cancers. One of the studies with a statistically significant relationship for all-cancer mortality observed similar results for lung or digestive cancer mortality, but no such relationship for \"other cancers\" . In the Whitehall Study, which is a cohort of British middle-aged men, among those who were physically inactive, a worse prognosis was observed for all-cancer or hematopoietic cancer mortality, but no significant association was found for mortality from lung or colorectal cancer . Another analysis from the Whitehall Study observed an inverse relationship between the number of minutes walking or bicycling to work each day and lung cancer mortality, but no association for all-cancer mortality or death from prostate, colon, hematopoietic, stomach, rectal, or pancreatic cancers . One study looked exclusively at pancreatic cancer mortality and found no association with physical activity level .Many possible explanations can be offered for the equivocal results. There was tremendous heterogeneity between these cohorts with regard to gender, age, study size, period of enrollment, geographic location, number of years of follow-up, and the year of study enrollment when physical activity was assessed. As with the studies in the preceding section, the physical activity assessment was seldom consistent and few measured all three major components of exercise: frequency, duration, and intensity. A big concern with long-term cohorts is the potential for misclassification of the physical activity exposure if the activity level measured at baseline is not reflective of average levels prior to the time of study entry or changes in activity during the follow-up period.Most of these studies measured physical activity only once at baseline and none attempted to assess lifetime activity. One study combined 5 years of physical activity assessments over a 12year period to obtain a cumulative average activity level . Another study assessed activity at baseline and again 4.7 to 7 years later to assess the effect of changes in activity level. In this study, no association was present for the baseline measure alone, but those who were sedentary at baseline and then considered active at the second interval had a significantly lower risk of cancer death compared to those who were sedentary at both points in time .Although the relationship between physical activity and risk of cancer death remains inconclusive, a small majority of the studies listed in Table 26.2 point in the direction of a preventive role of physical activity on cancer mortality. More research with better assessment methods for physical activity among cohorts of cancer survivors is clearly needed.\n",

      "Studies examining the prevalence of recreational physical activity among cancer survivors are described in Table 26.3. These employ several different types of study designs. Several studies simply reported the prevalence of activity. A study of prostate and breast cancer survivors found the majority reported being active on a routine weekly basis . However, another small study of breast cancer patients found most women to exercise below American College of Sports Medicine guidelines . A report on survivors of childhood cancers found that those who were still under age 18 remained relatively active, but that survivors over 18 were active much less frequently .Activity levels of long-term cancer survivors were compared to controls in two of the most recent studies. One Norwegian study reported higher levels of activity for the testicular cancer survivors compared to controls sampled from the generalStudy populatir 6 cases and 16,880 ged ≥ 18 years from ged ≥ 18 years from a ysical activity meast quency and duration ght, moderate, or gorous activityStudy population 12 cases in New Mexico and Washington iagnosis an PA measure ince diagnos 12 month uthor, year, ref win, 2003, 37 population . The other study, based on the National Health Interview Study cohort, found a comparable proportion of breast cancer survivors and noncases to be active overall . However, the survivors in this study were more likely to meet the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for vigorous activity or total activity, but had a similar likelihood of meeting the guidelines for light or moderate activity.Two studies retrospectively measured pre- and postdiagnosis exercise levels. A study of adult cancer survivors found 15.7% exercised more, 53.6% exercised the same amount, and 30.6% exercised less after diagnosis compared with the earlier prediagnostic period . The survivors were more likely to increase their exercise levels following diagnosis if not currently undergoing treatment and if interviewed more than a year since their diagnosis. In a similar study of breast cancer survivors interviewed 4 to 12 months following diagnosis, activity levels decreased by 2 hours/week from pre- to postdiagnosis . Decreases were greatest for women treated with radiation and chemotherapy compared to surgery or radiation alone as well as for those who were obese compared to normal weight women.Two studies of breast cancer survivors and one with colorectal cancer survivors examined physical activity participation before diagnosis, during cancer treatment, and post-treatment . These studies generally found one quarter to one third of survivors remained consistently active or inactive at all three periods. Another large group was found to be inactive only during the treatment period; a significant proportion of those who were active prior to diagnosis never resumed an active lifestyle following treatment.These studies provide some insight into the impact of a cancer diagnosis on physical activity behaviors. In particular, cancer patients undergo special challenges associated with treatment, such as fatigue and weight change, that may affect ability or interest in maintaining or initiating exercise. Although activity appears to diminish in the treatment phase, the studies of longer term survivors suggest that perhaps activity levels eventually resume to prediagnosis levels for most people or, at least, levels comparable to the general population. However, it is unclear how quickly activity increases during the post-treatment period.From a methodological standpoint, it may not be sufficient to assess only prediagnosis activity in studies of physical activity and survival if prediagnosis levels are not reflective of postdiagnosis levels. To clarify whether pre- and/or postdiagnosis exercise influences survival, future studies will need to include comprehensive assessment of activity through the life course as well as the postdiagnostic period.\n",

      "This review exposes the scarcity of research on whether survival is enhanced among those who are physically active, occupationally or recreationally, before or after cancer diagnosis. There is a strong need for further identification of new prognostic factors to improve the prediction of women at increased risk for recurrence or mortality. Physical activity is particularly noteworthy because it is a modifiable factor that could provide an opportunity for patients to enhance their survival. In addition to studying the impact of exercise on survival outcomes among cohorts of survivors, intervention studies of the physiological effects of activity among cancer patients are warranted in order to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms.Most studies reviewed here were conducted among breast cancer survivors. Future studies should include patients of different cancer sites and stages because of considerable variation in pathogenesis, mortality rates, and treatment-related problems. More thorough and comprehensive physical activity assessments that incorporate measures of intensity, duration, frequency, and timing of the activity would aid in determining the true relationship between physical activity and prognosis.\n",

      "Energy balance, as reflected by body size, has received considerable attention as a potential prognostic factor in breast cancer. In 1976, Abe first reported an association of obesity with poor outcome in early stage breast cancer. As of early 2004, over 50 studies examining this association had been published . The majority of the studies in locoregional breast cancer have identified an adverse prognostic effect of obesity, leading to a growing consensus that obesity is a significant and independent adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer. One recent review concluded that \"the current evidence relating increased body weight to breast cancer outcome and the documented favorable effects of weight loss on clinical outcome in other comorbid conditions support consideration of programs for weight loss in breast cancer patients.\" Thus, there is interest in the development of weight loss programs targeting women with breast cancer and, more importantly, in studying the effect of such programs on the outcomes of these women.In parallel to this research examining prognostic effects of weight in breast cancer, additional work has investigated the phenomenon of weight gain after diagnosis of locoregional breast cancer . This research has demonstrated that weight gain in this situation is common and is associated with a variety of factors . Some evidence indicates that large amounts of weight gain postdiagnosis may contribute to poor breast cancer outcomes. These observations have enhanced interest in the development of weight management programs for women with breast cancer.More recently, research has increasingly focused on understanding the underlying physiological basis for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity in breast cancer . Several potential mechanisms for this effect have been hypothesized; the majority focus on alterations in hormone levels in obese individuals. Recent research has suggested that insulin, a member of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors, may also play an important role. Alternate explanations include suggestions that obesity is associated with presentation of breast cancer at more advanced stages or that it may lead to undertreatment, particularly in those receiving chemotherapy. These potential mechanisms will be discussed.Despite the growing consensus that obesity is associated with breast cancer outcome, a detailed review of the evidence supporting this potential association is necessary. The 51 published studies of obesity and locoregional breast cancer prognosis will be reviewed in the next section, followed by a discussion of weight gain postdiagnosis. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity will be discussed in subsequent sections.\n",

      "The majority of studies calculated a measure of obesity, usually BMI , to analyze prognostic effects. Because such measures take the relationship of weight to height into consideration, they may provide information that is more biologically meaningful than weight alone.Only 21 studies reported on the use of systemic adjuvant therapy in their study population ; many of these included the effects of such treatment in adjusted prognostic analyses. However, the majority of studies did not address the issue of systemic adjuvant therapy, descriptively or in their analyses. Often this was because subjects were diagnosed prior to the widespread use of systemic adjuvant therapy; however, many studies of women diagnosed after 1980 did not consider this potentially important factor. Furthermore, although most studies attempted to consider effects of other prognostic factors by analyzing effects of obesity in subsets of women or by conducting multivariate prognostic analyses, few studies considered effects of all potentially important confounders.As can be seen from Table 27.1, the majority of studies identified an adverse prognostic effect of obesity in women with locoregional breast cancer. In total, 36 studies, representing 35,103 women , identified a significant adverse effect of weight or obesity overall or in a subset of women. In contrast, 15 studies involving 12,949 women failed to identify a significant adverse effect of body size. The magnitude of the prognostic effect was not always reported and, when it was, comparison groups were not consistent. Some authors reported hazard ratios for subjects above and below an average weight ; others reported HRs for subjects above a specific BMI cutpoint compared to those with a \"normal\" BMI or per unit BMI . In general, when effect sizes were reported, they were moderate, obese women having an increased risk of recurrence or death in the range of 1.5 to 2.5.In some studies, when extremes were examined, they were associated with larger risk . These observations are in keeping with an earlier meta-analysis in which over 30 studies were included. The HRs for distant recurrence and death in overweight women were 1.91 and 1.56 , respectively. Vatten et al. calculated the attributable risk of death in breast cancer due to BMI > 27 kg/m² to be approximately 50% in their study, suggesting that the contribution of obesity to breast cancer outcome may be of considerable clinical relevance.Some evidence indicates that the association of obesity with breast cancer outcome may not be linear. Curvilinear associations were reported in two studies but not confirmed in another study . Body size was treated as an ordinal variable in many studies ; in these studies, the linear nature of the association could not be examined. Nonetheless, it appears that prognostic effects of BMI are probably greatest in the most overweight women and that underweight women may also have poor outcomes.No characteristics of study design consistently distinguished studies identifying significant adverse effects of obesity from those that did not. Early as well as recent studies have identified, or failed to identify, significant adverse effects. Mean sample size in \"positive\" studies was 981 women and, in \"negative\" studies, it was 831 - a difference unlikely to account for the observed variability in results. The smallest study , involving 25 women, identified a significant adverse prognostic effect of overweight and obesity at 10 years. The measure of body size investigated also did not predict results; significant adverse effects were identified when body size was measured as weight, percent ideal weight, or an obesity index and when body size was treated continuously or ordinally in analyses. As noted previously, some studies measured body size years prior to diagnosis;many of these studies identified significant adverse prognostic effects of obesity, although effects of body size on breast cancer risk may confound these results.The results reported by Dignam et al. suggest that obesity may increase risk of new primary cancers and non-breast cancer related mortality but not breast cancer recurrence or death. That is, it may not actually have an effect on breast cancer progression. However, results of the full range of studies suggest that this is not the case. Of the studies listed in Table 27.1, 27 reported associations of obesity with overall survival ; 17 of these identified significantly increased risk in obese women. Breast cancer-specific mortality was examined in 25 studies; 17 of these identified significant adverse effects of obesity. The effect of obesity on breast cancer recurrence was evaluated in 20 studies; 13 identified adverse effects. Finally, 40 studies considered effects of obesity on at least one breast cancer-specific outcome . Of these, 28 identified significant adverse effects.Thus, there is little evidence that adverse prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer are due to effects on non-breast-cancer deaths; on the contrary, a slightly greater proportion of studies that evaluated breast cancer-specific outcomes identified adverse prognostic effects when compared to studies evaluating all-cause mortality. Dignam et al. studied women with low-risk breast cancer , many of whom received tamoxifen. Failure to identify effects of obesity on breast cancer outcomes may reflect low breast cancer event rates, and a greater relative contribution of competing causes of deaths in this good prognosis population.One possible explanation for the inconsistent prognostic effects of obesity reported is that obesity exerts a prognostic effect present only in a subgroup of women. Differential effects according to menopausal status or hormone receptor status have been most commonly postulated. Studies investigating these subsets are summarized in Table 27.2 and Table 27.3.Given that the association of obesity with breast cancer risk varies according to menopausal status, it is plausible that prognostic effects of obesity might differ with respect to menopausal status. Obesity is associated with an increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women and a decreased risk in premenopausal woman ). In Table 27.2, results of studies that reported prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal and postmenopausal women separately are summarized. Prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal women were evaluated in 13 studies. Eight of these identified significant adverse effects, despite the fact that sample sizes were considerably smaller than in the full studies listed in Table 27.1. Six of the 14 studies that evaluated prognostic effects in postmenopausal women identified significant adverse effects of obesity. Once again, these analyses were usually conducted in subsets of the overall study population, leading to reduced power.These results suggest that an adverse prognostic effect of obesity is present in pre- and postmenopausal women and, in contrast to the impact of obesity on breast cancer risk, its impact on prognosis may be greatest in premenopausal women. As will be discussed later, this observation has implications for understanding potential pathophysiological mechanisms for prognostic effects of obesity.Prognostic effects of obesity in hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative breast cancer have been reported in a smaller number of studies . Two early studies provide evidence that the prognostic effect of obesity may be greatest in estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive individuals. As noted earlier, a recent study by Dignam et al. analyzed prognostic effects of obesity in the NSABP-B14 study conducted in estrogen receptor-positive, node negative-breast cancer. This study failed to identify an effect of obesity on breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer death, despite the finding of an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer and increased all-cause mortality in obese individuals. The majority of women in that study received tamoxifen, and it is possible that administration of tamoxifen to women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer may abrogate the adverse prognostic effects of obesity.2 1.13 for weight ≥ 64 kg vs. < 64 kg, = 0.28 BMI adversely associated with OS HR 1.7 for W > 140 and 1.6 for BMI > o significant associatio f W, BMI with OSnificant adverse effect of weight Ijusted for stage, nodes), p = 0.043 verse effect of Q similar in all age coups 544 ਮੰਟfigher BMI associated with increased 1.02–1.17, p = 0.01 per kg m² — 1.02 1.02–1.17, p = 0.01 per kg/m² — 0.007) 250< 45 y.o. figh BMI an independent predictor of mortality for highest vs. lowest quarter Io effect of BMI on recurrence or BC 2350 aling , 200A second study reported a reduced risk of death in obese vs. nonobese women who were estrogen receptor negative. Unfortunately, the small number of studies that have investigated prognostic effects of obesity according to estrogen receptor status, coupled with the small numbers of subjects with receptor-negative tumors, make it difficult to draw conclusions about the potential for differential effects of obesity in receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer. Additional research in this area, which also examines interactions with hormonal adjuvant therapies , is needed to resolve this issue.The question of whether prognostic effects of obesity differ according to the presence or absence of other tumor characteristics was addressed in the 13 studies summarized in Table 27.4. With some exceptions, these studies identified effects that were greatest in tumors with favorable prognostic factors - usually defined as small tumor size, less advanced tumor stage, or uninvolved axillary lymph nodes. Taken together with results in hormone receptor-positive cancers summarized in Table 27.3, these results suggest that adverse prognostic effects of obesity may be greatest in lower risk breast cancers, but they are not absent in higher risk cancersThis observation contrasts to some extent with growing evidence, summarized in Table 27.5, that obese women are more likely to have breast cancers that have unfavorable prognostic characteristics. In the majority of studies that examined this relationship, obesity was associated with advanced stage, larger tumor size, and/or greater axillary nodal involvement. Inconsistent associations of obesity with estrogen receptor status have been reported. Because of these observations, it has been suggested that adverse prognostic effects of obesity may not be independent of traditional prognostic factors - that is, obese women may present with more advanced stage breast cancer, possibly due to delayed diagnosis.\n",

      "However, this appears to be unlikely as the sole explanation for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity, given that the adverse prognostic effect of obesity identified in studies listed in Table 27.1 persisted after adjustment for many prognostic factors, notably tumor stage and nodal status, and, at times, hormone receptor status and tumor grade in the majority of studies that conducted such analyses. In at least one study , an adverse effect of obesity was seen only after adjustment for such factors.As noted earlier, only a minority of the studies listed in Table 27.1 reported use of adjuvant systemic therapy - chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Furthermore, in most of the studies that did report use of systemic adjuvant therapy, not all women received such therapy and prognostic effects of obesity were rarely reported after adjustment for adjuvant therapy or only in those receiving adjuvant therapy. Nonetheless, two recent studies conducted in the context of randomized clinical trials of systemic therapy failed to identify adverse prognostic effects of obesity on breast cancer recurrence or death in those receiving chemotherapy or tamoxifen . As noted previously, adverse effects of obesity on contralateral breast cancer and on all-cause mortality were noted in the latter study.Daling et al. reported that adverse effects of obesity present in the overall study population and in those receiving non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy were not present in those who received doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. These observations raise the question of whether modern adjuvant systemic adjuvant therapies abrogate prognostic effects of obesity in locoregional breast cancer. This is an area that should be an urgent focus for future research because this would influence the design of future intervention studies.The preceding discussion has focused on locoregional breast cancer. A small number of studies has investigated prognostic effects of obesity in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer . An adverse effect of obesity was seen in only one of these studies . However, the available data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions about effects of obesity on outcomes in metastatic breast cancer.In summary, the prognostic effects of obesity in locoregional breast cancer have been extensively studied. The preponderance of evidence supports an adverse effect on breast cancer outcomes . The effect is moderate in size and may be most pronounced, but not exclusive to, tumors with characteristics that are usually associated with favorable outcomes. Obesity influences prognosis in pre- and postmenopausal women. However, despite this extensive body of research, important questions remain. These include whether effects of obesity differ according to hormone receptor status and, more importantly, whether obesity influences prognosis in women receiving current adjuvant therapies, including anthracyclines, taxanes, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors.\n",

      "Weight gain after diagnosis of locoregional breast cancer was first reported by Dixon et al. in 1978 . Since that time, over 35 studies have examined this phenomenon. All but two of these studies have found evidence of weight gain during the first year or two after breast cancer diagnosis. This weight gain has been shown to be associated with anxiety over appearance and with reduced quality of life . The weight gain reported has been of variable magnitude with averages ranging from more than 10 kg over 1 year to approximately 1 kg . Some studies have reported weight gain to occur in almost 100% of women ; others have reported lower prevalence. Weight gain in the range of 1 to 3 kg during the first year after diagnosis has been most commonly reported, particularly in recent studies. Earlier studies tended to identify greater weight gain than more recent studies, likely reflecting changes in adjuvant therapy and, perhaps, greater clinician and patient awareness that weight gain is a potential problem.It was initially hypothesized that this postdiagnosis weight gain was related to overeating. possibly in an attempt to relieve chemotherapy-associated nausea. However, evidence supporting that hypothesis is weak and a number of other factors have emerged as being associated with weight gain. Summarized in Table 27.6, these factors can be grouped into several categories. The first relates to menopausal status. Young age, premenopausal status, and onset of menopause have been fairly consistently associated with greater weight gain. The second factor that has been most consistently associated with weight gain is systemic adjuvant therapy. The use of chemotherapy has been associated with the greatest degree of weight gain .Two studies have demonstrated that anthracycline-based chemotherapy is associated with less weight gain than non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Longer duration of adjuvant chemotherapy in earlier studies may have contributed to the larger weight gain reported prior to the 1990s; older chemotherapy protocols that included prednisone and ovarian ablation were also associated with greater degrees of weight gain, as were multiagent chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy combined with hormonal interventions such\n",

      "as medroxyprogesterone acetate or leuprorelin has also been associated with greater weight gain. There is some controversy as to whether tamoxifen is associated with weight gain. Two studies have identified significant weight gain in women receiving tamoxifen and two have not . Regardless, weight gain in women on tamoxifen is minor and may be comparable to that seen in the general population .Weight gain has been reported to be greatest in women who have lower BMI when initially diagnosed . Psychological distress and/or a disinhibited pattern of eating have also been associated with greater weight gain . High caloric intake has been inconsistently associated with weight gain; the majority of studies have failed to find an association . Similarly, reduced physical activity has been inconsistently associated with weight gain . Several studies have reported reduced resting metabolic rate in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy , suggesting that reduced resting energy expenditure that is not balanced by reduced energy intake may contribute to the weight gain seen in these patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been postulated as a potential underlying cause of postdiagnosis weight gain .The nature of the weight gain that occurs during adjuvant chemotherapy has been investigated in several studies. Demark-Wahnefried et al. have provided evidence that this weight gain is associated with an increase in fat mass accompanied by a decrease in lean body mass, a pattern seen with sarcopenic obesity . Sarcopenic obesity has been observed with chronic use of corticosteroids, prolonged physical inactivity, or hypopituitartism or hypogonadism, as well as increasing age and menopause. Additional studies have shown that weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis is associated with increased fat mass and/or decreased fat-free or lean mass . This suggests that weight gain during adjuvant chemotherapy is due to positive energy balance resulting from reduced energy expenditure with no compensatory reduction in energy intake.Taken together, these observations suggest that interventions involving physical activity that would result in direct increases in energy expenditure, as well as secondary increases in resting energy expenditure as a result of increases in lean body mass , might be most useful in preventing weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis. In this regard, our group has conducted a phase II intervention study of a multidisciplinary weight management intervention in locoregional breast cancer. The intervention included physical activity and dietary interventionas well as psychosocial support. The most important predictor of successful weight management was physical activity; the likelihood of successful weight management increased 78% with every 30 additional minutes of physical activity weekly . Furthermore, Winningham has demonstrated that increases in physical activity during chemotherapy are associated with increases in lean mass.Prognostic effects of weight gain have been examined in seven studies . The average weight gain reported in these studies has varied from 1.21 kg over 1 year to more than 10 kg over 1 year. Three of these studies have identified adverse prognostic effects of postdiagnosis weight gain . These three studies were those in which average weight gain was the largest, varying from 5.9 to more than 10 kg. These observations suggest that weight gain postdiagnosis contributes to the adverse prognostic effect of obesity at diagnosis, but that the degree of weight gain must be considerable before this adverse prognostic effect can be identified. These observations provide support for the use of interventions to prevent weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis and strengthen the rationale for research to investigate the impact of interventions designed to promote weight loss after breast cancer diagnosis.\n",

      "A number of factors have been proposed as potential mediators of an adverse prognostic effect of obesity. The first of these, presentation of breast cancer at a more advanced stage in obese women, was discussed earlier. Although breast cancers developing in obese women are more likely to have unfavorable prognostic characteristics, available evidence suggests that adverse prognostic effects of obesity are independent of those prognostic factors. It has also been suggested that chemotherapy underdosing in obese women - a practice that may have been more common in the past than it is currently - may contribute to adverse prognostic effects of obesity . It is possible that this has played a role in women receiving chemotherapy in the past; however, such underdosing is less common today. Furthermore, the majority of studies that identified adverse prognostic effects of obesity involved women who were not receiving chemotherapy, suggesting that this is not a primary mechanism for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity.Hormonal factors have received the most attention as potential mediators of adverse prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer . Obesity is associated with higher circulating levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women, due to increased peripheral aromatization of androstenedione to estriol, which is subsequently converted to estradiol, coupled with reduced circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin , leading to increased levels of free estrogen. This may contribute to adverse prognostic effects of obesity in postmenopausal breast cancer. Some evidence indicates that obese postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer experience a significantly reduced response rate when treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole . However, increased estrogen levels are unlikely to be a central explanation for prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal women in whom the ovaries are the major source of estrogen production. Furthermore, in one study , circulating estradiol levels were not strongly associated with obesity, were not associated with outcome, and did not mediate adverse prognostic effects of obesity in women with locoregional breast cancer; this suggests that other factors play important roles.Recent research has focused on the role of insulin and other members of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors in mediating adverse prognostic effects of obesity . Obesity is associated with the insulin resistance syndrome . The relative resistance of insulin receptors in skeletal muscle and other tissues to metabolic effects of insulin leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia in an attempt to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. However, insulin and IGF-I receptors are overexpressed in breast cancer cells and are not insulin resistant . Activation of these tyrosine kinase receptors results in activation of insulin response substrate-I and downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositidyl-3 kinase/akt pathway , leading to proliferation and growth . The role of the insulin resistance syndrome in cancer risk is discussed in Chapter 20 .Insulin not only interacts with its own receptor in breast cancer cells, but also contributes to regulation of IGF-I and IGF binding proteins. These entities, in turn, interact in a complex fashion with the receptors of this growth factor family, leading to further activation of the signaling pathways described previously. The relative contribution of insulin and the IGFs and their cognate receptors in these mitogenic signaling pathways remains an area of intense research interest .Empiric evidence for an important role of insulin in mediation of adverse prognostic effects of obesity has been provided . In a cohort of 535 women with newly diagnosed locoregional breast cancer, fasting insulin levels were strongly correlated with BMI . High fasting insulin levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence and death, independent of effects of BMI and other prognostic factors. Women whose insulin levels were in the upper quartile had a 2.1-fold increased risk of distant recurrence and a 3.3-fold increased risk of death compared to women whose insulin levels were in the lowest quartile. In the same cohort, circulating levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 were not convincingly associated with outcome . Rose et al. have recently suggested that leptin, an adipocytokine associated with cell growth, migration, and invasion as well as angiogenesis, may play a role in prognostic effects of obesity, perhaps in association with insulin. However, in the cohort study described above, leptin did not make independent contributions to breast cancer outcome .It is unlikely that any of these mechanisms act alone. Insulin and IGFs contribute to regulation of aromatase activity and SHBG levels , and cross-talk exists between insulin/IGF signaling pathways and estrogen signaling pathways within breast cancer cells , leading to the possibility that these mechanisms act in concert to affect prognosis adversely). One potential schema for such interaction is shown in Figure 27.1.Further research to enhance understanding of factors mediating adverse prognostic effects of obesity is urgently needed. Such research is expected to contribute to development of targeted therapies to reverse adverse effects of obesity. These interventions should be pursued in parallel to research that directly addresses obesity through a variety of lifestyle and possibly pharmacological interventions.\n",

      "A large body of research has investigated prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer. This research conclusively demonstrates that obesity exerts an adverse prognostic effect on disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. The effect is moderate in size, with hazard ratios for obese compared to nonobese women in the range of 2. This corresponded to an approximate attributable risk of 50% in one study , an effect that is highly relevant clinically. The adverse prognostic effect of obesity appears to be independent of stage at presentation and of other prognostic factors and to be present in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Some evidence suggests that it is probably present in women receiving modern adjuvant chemotherapy; however, further research to confirm this is needed.Weight gain is common after breast cancer diagnosis; the magnitude of this weight gain has become smaller in recent years, likely reflecting increasing awareness of the phenomenon, as well as more widespread use of shorter term, anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which is associated with less weight gain. A growing consensus is that weight gain during adjuvant chemotherapy is due to reduced energy expenditure in the absence of reduction in caloric intake. It is likely that interventions focusing on physical activity will be effective in preventing this weight gain.The situation with respect to obesity at breast cancer diagnosis is somewhat more complex. It is likely that this obesity is due to a complex group of factors, similar to those seen in the general population - including excess caloric intake and excess dietary fat intake, as well as reduced physical activity - that have resulted in imbalances in energy balance. The positive energy balance that results in obesity at breast cancer diagnosis is probably long term. In this situation, multifactorial interventions will likely be necessary. Such interventions should target energy intake and energy expenditure and may require psychosocial components to address motivational issues. Considerable work has been done to develop interventions targeting obesity in women with breast cancer. This work has shownthat physical activity and dietary modification are feasible and that modest weight loss is possible. These issues will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 34 and Chapter 35.In parallel to this observational work regarding obesity and weight gain in breast cancer, there has been enhanced understanding of the pathophysiological basis for a contribution of obesity to breast cancer outcome. A number of hormonal mechanisms have been postulated, and empiric evidence supports the role of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors, which likely act in concert with estrogenic mechanisms.Although much is known about obesity and breast cancer outcome, additional research is needed. Observational research to examine the effect of obesity as a prognostic factor in women receiving modern adjuvant therapies, including anthracyclines, taxanes, and aromatase inhibitors, is recommended. This research could be most efficiently conducted in the context of ongoing and completed randomized clinical trials. Additionally, research to understand the pathophysiology of prognostic effects of obesity will likely yield important information that can be used to develop targeted therapies in women unable or unwilling to lose weight. Such interventions could potentially include insulin or IGF receptor blockers. Finally, research will be needed to ascertain the benefits of weight loss after breast cancer diagnosis. Demonstration of a probable link between obesity and poor prognosis does not mean that reversal of obesity will result in improved outcomes; this must be demonstrated in well designed, randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, it is likely that a single intervention to promote weight loss will not work for all women with breast cancer, so evaluation of a variety of interventions and motivational approaches is warranted.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity are clinical indicators of energy imbalance or, specifically, excess energy intake relative to expenditure. Overweight and obesity are clearly associated with increased risk for several chronic diseases and conditions, including type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, and osteoarthritis . In the general population, excess body weight also has been observed to be significantly associated with increased mortality from all cancers combined and for cancers of several specific sites .Based on fairly consisting findings from numerous studies, obesity appears to be an important negative prognostic factor for women who have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Fewer studies have examined the associations between energy imbalance and recurrence or survival after the diagnosis of other types of cancer. However, this is an area of current interest, particularly in view of the increasing rates of obesity in the U.S., and studies that can address this issue are ongoing.Several mechanisms to explain the association between overweight or obesity and prognosis following the diagnosis of cancer have been suggested. Alterations in metabolic and hormonal factors that may affect cancer progression, such as gonadal reproductive hormones, insulin, and other growth factors, are possible mediating factors , but other factors also may explain how obesity affects survival. For example, optimal surgical procedures for accurate diagnosis and initial treatment may be compromised by excess adiposity . Chemotherapy regimens have generally been developed and tested in clinical studies involving mainly normal-weight individuals; the obese patient presents with altered body composition and altered pharmokinetics due to obesity-related differences in hepatic and renal function .In the studies that have examined associations between overweight or obesity and survival following the diagnosis of cancer, the subjects originate from different potential sources or pools, which influences the nature of the available data and the characteristics of the sample. They may be cases originally identified for case-control studies, cases that occur in clinical trials or ongoing cohort studies, or cases identified through hospital-based care and evaluated as a clinical series report . In the reported studies, the effect of obesity on prognosis is typically examined using premorbid weight or weight at diagnosis. Thus, the issue of whether postdiagnosis weight reduction through diet and/or increased physical activity can modify the relationship usually cannot be addressed.Also, overweight or obesity is not uniformly defined across these studies, and approaches used include calculating relative weight or comparing across subgroups using an arbitrary cut-point. The most common approach to defining overweight or obesity is based on the calculated body mass index . BMI should be considered an indicator rather than a specific measure of adiposity; in adults, this index correlates better with total body fat at the ends of the spectrum than in the midrange .\n",

      "The relationship between overweight or obesity and prognosis following the diagnosis of colon cancer has been examined in a few studies. In an early study. Tartter et al. examined cumulative 5-year recurrence-free rates in 279 stage III colon cancer patients identified over a 3-year period at a medical center in relation to weight, height, and an index of obesity . Overall, patients above the median weight were found to be at significantly increased risk of recurrence , and women above the median obesity index score were at significantly greater risk of recurrence . Slattery et al. subsequently examined the relationships among BMI, selected dietary factors, and survival in 411 colon cancer cases identified through two population-based case-control studies, with a median follow-up of 56 months. After underweight patients were excluded, increasing BMI was associated with a nonsignificant increase in overall mortality, although energy intake was found to be associated directly with survival.Relevant findings were reported in a more recent study of survival in relation to dietary factors in 171 cases of colorectal cancer identified through another case-control study . In this study, high energy intake was again associated with increased likelihood of survival: 5-year relative risk of death for the highest vs. the two lowest tertiles of energy intake was 0.18 . However, accurate estimates of energy intake are difficult to obtain with the dietary assessment approaches used in epidemiological studies, so the interpretation of these findings is constrained.Within a large, randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial, the relationships between BMI and outcomes over a median follow-up of 9.4 years were recently examined in 3759 patients with stage II to stage III colon cancer . Compared with normal-weight women , obese women experienced significantly worse overall mortality and a nonsignificant increase in risk for recurrence . BMI was unrelated to mortality or risk for recurrence in men in that study.In another study that focused specifically on rectal cancer and used the same cut-points for defining obesity, the relationships between BMI and outcomes were examined in a target group of 1688 participants in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy clinical trial . In that study, obese men with rectal cancer were more likely than normal-weight men to have a local recurrence . However, obesity was unrelated to risk for recurrence in women, and BMI was not associated with overall mortality in men or women.Based on the few studies reported to date, some evidence, although not conclusive or consistent, indicates that energy imbalance resulting in overweight or obesity may influence risk for recurrence and survival following the diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer. However, this is not an established relationship.\n",

      "Results of two studies that examined several dietary and nutritional factors, including obesity, and survival after the diagnosis of prostate cancer have been reported, both based on cases identified through population-based case-control studies. Meyer et al. prospectively followed 384 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a median duration of follow-up of 5.2 years. When adjusted for known prognostic factors. BMI was not found to be related to mortality in that study. In a group of 408 men diagnosed with prostate cancer who were followed for a median of 4.9 years, Kim et al. similarly observed no relationship between BMI and survival.The relationship between obesity and 5-year tumor-specific mortality also was examined in a clinical series of 235 men identified at a community hospital . In that study, men who were at least 10% overweight were less likely to have advanced tumors. When they were subgrouped and examined by obesity and smoking status, tumor-specific mortality was lower in obese than nonobese nonsmokers, and in obese nonsmokers compared to all other subgroups : this reflects lower mortality in those with tumors of identical stages and a larger percent with less advanced tumors. In contrast, in a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological data from 860 patients, Amling et al. found that obese vs. nonobese patients with prostate cancer present for radical prostatectomy at a younger age with higher grade and more pathologically advanced cancers.The relationship between obesity and risk for biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy was examined in one study involving data from 1106 men identified through a multi-institutional database, with a median follow-up of 33 months . Moderate and severe obesity , relative to lower BMI levels, was significantly associated with risk for biochemical recurrence . Controlled for all preoperative clinical variables and year of surgery, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² was found to be significantly associated with increased likelihood of biochemical recurrence : however, differences across categories of lower ranges of BMI were not observed.Clearly, the divergent results from studies to date that have examined whether overweight or obesity influences survival after the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer preclude wellsupported conclusions at this time. Data from a large, ongoing randomized controlled trial testing the effect of supplemental micronutrients on the incidence of primary prostate cancer are expected to provide some additional insight relating to energy imbalance and survival . Although incident prostate cancer is the primary endpoint for that trial, secondary endpoints will include prostate cancer-free survival and all-cause mortality. Extensive data on nutritional factors are being collected as well.\n",

      "To date, only one epidemiological study has examined the relationship between nutritional factors, including selected dietary intakes and obesity, and survival following the diagnosis of ovarian cancer . In a cohort of 609 women with invasive ovarian cancer, 5-year survival was examined inrelation to intakes and BMI, adjusted for known prognostic factors. When compared across tertiles , BMI was unrelated to survival. However, the investigators noted that women with BMI < 20 kg/m² had a somewhat better likelihood of survival than the rest of the women, although this difference was not statistically significant .\n",

      "The relationships among overweight or obesity, tumor characteristics, and survival following the diagnosis of endometrial cancer have been examined in three retrospective studies. Anderson et al. analyzed data from 492 women with endometrial carcinoma who were identified through a medical center database, with a mean follow-up of 4.2 years. Analyzed as a continuous variable, BMI was directly related to time to recurrence , and a marginally significant protective effect was found for survival . Notably, the heavier patients were more likely to have less aggressive disease, indicated by a higher incidence of better differentiated, less invasive adenocarcinomas in those women in that study.Similar findings were reported by Everett et al. in 396 patients who also were identified through a single medical center database and had a median 27-month follow-up period . No differences in survival were observed across three categories of BMI . Similar to the study by Anderson et al. , a beneficial effect of obesity on risk for recurrence was marginally significant in this study , when adjusted for covariates such as grade, nodes, myometrial invasion, and stage. Also, patients with BMI > 40 kg/m² were more likely to have endometrioid histology, lower stage disease, and lower grade tumors than women with BMI < 30 kg/m². However, 23% of the women with BMI > 40 kg/m² who had complete surgical staging with lymphadenectomy were found to be stage II and higher, indicating evidence for cervical or extrauterine disease.In a retrospective analysis of data from 121 women treated for endometrial carcinoma at a Polish hospital , obese patients had a longer 5-year survival compared to nonobese patients . When examined across BMI categories, patients with \"mild obesity\" had the longest 5-year survival rate, and patients with \"morbid obesity\" had the same survival rate as normal-weight patients as defined by being in an appropriate BMI category.Although only a few relevant studies have been reported, current evidence suggests that obesity may not be a negative prognostic factor for endometrial cancer. However, there are complicating issues in fully describing risk for recurrence or cancer progression in this patient population. Complete surgical staging via lymphadenectomy is sometimes not performed if the pathologic findings suggest that the patient is at low risk of recurrence . In both of the two studies that addressed the issue, obesity was found to be associated with more favorable tumor characteristics, which suggests that the available data and the accurate interpretation of findings are complicated.\n",

      "The relationship between overweight or obesity and survival following the diagnosis of cervical cancer has been examined in two retrospective studies. Based on data from 175 patients diagnosed with advanced squamous cell cervical cancer at a medical center, 5-year survival was observed to be unrelated to obesity . Although the definition of obesity in that study was not provided, obese patients reportedly had a 39% survival compared to 35% survival for nonobese patients.In a retrospective review of 302 cases of primary cervical adenocarcinoma at a Taiwanese hospital, the relationships between various prognostic factors and 5-year survival were examined for a median follow-up period of 63 months . Obesity was tested for effect as a dichotomous variable and was not significantly independently related to survival in that study.Thus, both of the studies that have addressed the question of whether obesity affects risk for recurrence or survival in women who have been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer found no relationship. However, the approaches used to examine this issue were crude, and more data and analysis relating to this area are needed prior to drawing conclusions.\n",

      "Contrasting findings have been reported in two retrospective studies of the relationship between obesity and survival in women who have been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell vulvar carcinoma. Based on data from 50 cases identified at a Greek hospital, with a median follow-up of 61 months. Kouvaris et al. found that overall survival was lower in women defined as obese . In contrast. Kirschner et al. found no relationship between obesity and survival in 136 cases identified at a medical center, with a median follow-up of 69.3 months. Given the limited available data and divergent results from these studies, conclusions regarding a possible relationship between energy imbalance and survival in vulvar cancer would be premature at this time.\n",

      "Whether overweight or obesity is associated with risk for recurrence or survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma has been addressed in one study. Yu et al. examined data from 360 renal cell carcinoma patients identified at multiple institutions; the majority of the cases had been identified in a prior case-control study. Obesity was associated with later recurrence and longer survival in that study. Adjusted for other potentially prognostic factors, the hazard ratio for disease recurrence between the obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 and the adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.68 .Data from 787 patients diagnosed and treated for gastric carcinoma at a Japanese hospital were examined to address whether obesity was associated with recurrence-free 5-year survival rates . Investigators found that significantly fewer lymph nodes were removed in D2 and D3 dissections in patients identified as obese . Furthermore, obesity was independently associated with shorter recurrence-free survival in T2/T3 cases in multivariate analysis , adjusted for other potentially influencing factors.Some clinical data in the scientific literature have suggested that overweight or obese patients are at increased risk for chemotherapy-related toxicity and adverse side effects, although the findings are not consistent. For example, examination of the clinical course of 262 patients treated for small-cell lung cancer with standard dose chemotherapies revealed no consistent associations of significance between increasing BMI levels and toxicity from therapy . In contrast, risk of death associated with high-dose chemotherapy and autograph treatment has been found to be substantially higher in patients with higher vs. lower BMI in a few studies.In a retrospective analysis of 121 patients administered this treatment, patients with BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 exhibited a risk of death of 2.9 compared to patients with lower BMI, adjusted for other influencing factors . In another similar study that focused on clinical data from 54 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, treatment-related toxicity and mortality, overall survival, and disease-free survival were all observed to be significantly adversely affected by obesity . In that study, patients were grouped as obese , underweight , and normal weight or nonobese, and the underweight subgroup was excluded from the analysis of outcomes.\n",

      "Evidence relating to the effect of energy imbalance, as indicated by overweight or obesity, and risk for recurrence or survival following the diagnosis of cancers other than breast cancer is rather limited. For colorectal cancer, available evidence does suggest the possibility of an unfavorable effect of overweight or obesity on survival, but some inconsistencies have been found in the results of the studies reported to date. Even more divergent results have been found in studies relating overweight or obesity to recurrence or survival following the diagnosis of prostate cancer.For cancers of other types, the current evidence is even more meager, with the evidence available consisting of very mixed results. Notably, the few studies relating to endometrial cancer that have published to date even suggest the possibility of a protective effect of obesity. Available data relating to cervical cancer are limited but consistently suggest a lack of effect of obesity on survival.Given the established relationship between overweight and obesity and risk for other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is an appropriate recommendation for cancer survivors . Regardless of a specific association with cancer progression, the well-established relationship of overweight and obesity, disease burden, and overall mortality provides a compelling reason to encourage energy balance in this target population .\n",

      "Basal energy expenditure or basal metabolic rate is defined as the energy expenditure of an individual lying at physical and mental rest in a thermoneutral environment, about 12 hours after the previous meal. Resting energy expenditure is measured in less rigorous conditions than basal energy expenditure is. Therefore, resting energy expenditure is considered to be approximately 5% higher than basal energy expenditure. The mean energy expenditure during sleep is slightly lower than during arousal and sleeping energy expenditure is about 10% lower than basal energy expenditure. However, despite small systematic differences, sleeping energy expenditure, basal energy expenditure, and resting energy expenditure are very strongly intercorrelated and the terms are often used interchangeably.The strongest determinant of basal energy expenditure is fat-free mass, which explains up to 80% of interindividual variation . The relationship seems to be linear, at least within a normal range of adult fat-free mass . The maximal interindividual variation at a given fatfree mass is about 2.1 MJ, indicating the possible magnitude of difference in resting energy expenditure between two individuals with a similar fat-free mass. Genetic variation, body composition, variation of hormone concentration, energy balance and physical fitness are factors that have been found to explain the variations of basal energy expenditure, after adjustment for fat-free mass . Physical activity, mainly strength training, may also increase absolute basal energy expenditure by increasing muscle mass.Basal energy expenditure is measured in the laboratory by using the ventilated hood method . This method is based on indirect calorimetry, that is, measurement of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation . Measurement of resting energy expenditure is carried out in the morning after an overnight fast. Strenuous physical activity and alcohol consumption are not allowed on the day preceding the measurement. Smoking is not allowed and any physical activity should be restricted between waking up and resting energy expenditure measurement. The measurements are taken while the subject is in a lying or half-sitting position, with a typical duration between 30 and 60 min. Basal energy expenditure can be calculated from the calorimetry data in several ways. We have used a 45-min measurement. The first 15 min data are not used. The meanenergy expenditure is calculated separately from 16- to 30-min and 31- to 45-min data, and the lower of these values is used as basal energy expenditure.Because of the technical constraints of basal energy expenditure measurements, determinations of energy requirements are usually based on predicted basal energy expenditure. Table 29.1 shows prediction equations for basal energy expenditure, as given by WHO/FAO/UNU . Several prediction equations use fat-free mass, with or without fat mass, as the independent variable. However, because most individuals do not know their fat-free mass and accurate assessment of body composition is difficult and time consuming, it may be equally acceptable to use prediction equations with body weight as the independent variable, and age and sex as classifying variables.Oxygen consumption at rest is approximately 3.5 ml/kg per minute . Therefore, a \"quick and dirty\" method to estimate resting energy expenditure is to use 1 kcal or 4.2 kJ per kilogram of body weight per minute. This is a very rough estimation, but gives an indication of the magnitude of resting energy expenditure.\n",

      "Diet-induced thermogenesis or diet-induced energy expenditure can be defined as the increase in energy expenditure above basal energy expenditure divided by the energy content of the food ingested . The postprandial rise in energy expenditure lasts for several hours, but about 90% of dietinduced thermogenesis is observed within 4 h of the meal. Diet-induced thermogenesis is assumed to be 10% of daily energy expenditure in individuals consuming an average mixed diet and being in energy balance. However, the diet-induced thermogenesis of fats is only 5% of their energy content, whereas diet-induced thermogenesis of proteins amounts to approximately 20%. Dietinduced thermogenesis of carbohydrates is normally around 10%, but may be up to 20%, if carbohydrates are directly converted to fat ; however, the latter does not normally occur in individuals consuming diets typical of European and North American countries .\n",

      "The previous part of this chapter was related to physical activity and total energy expenditure. Although muscle work always increases total energy expenditure, the use of energy substrates depends on the intensity level. Figure 29.3 illustrates the relative contribution of fats and carbohydrates during activities of different intensities . As the intensity is increased from light levels to above 30 to 40% VO, max , two changes take place: the muscle starts to use more intramuscular substrates and, especially, the use of muscle glycogen is increased. It is possible that the use of intramuscular substrates is a prerequisite for metabolic adaptations and many health benefits of physical activity (see the section on physical\n",

When the intensity reaches 65 to 75% VO2 max , muscle glycogen becomes the predominant energy source. It is conceivable that the oxidation of fat cannot cover the total energy needs during vigorous activity and that intramuscular carbohydrates are needed when the activity level is high .In addition to fats and carbohydrates, protein is also used as an energy source . In normal circumstances, the share of proteins is less than 5% of total energy expenditure. Deaminated amino acids are oxidized, some directly in the mitochondria and some after gluconeogenetic transformation to glucose. However, if muscle glycogen stores are depleted or if protein intake is much higher than the daily protein needs, the contribution of proteins may be much higher .Although the use of energy substrates clearly depends on the intensity of physical activity, many other factors may also contribute. The duration of physical activity is one important factor, particularly when the intensity is between 40 and 80% VO, max - that is, when intramuscular substrates are used for energy . Studies show a gradual shift from predominantly carbohydrate use to use of fats . The use of muscle glycogen and intramuscular triglycerides decreases as the exercise duration increases . Other factors affecting muscle substrate use are nutritional status , training history, and muscle fiber composition .Some people believe that low-intensity exercise, with increased proportional oxidation of fat, could be optimal for weight reduction and maintenance. In contrast, some studies have found higher postexercise energy expenditure after high-intensity exercise . Despite lay beliefs, the use of muscle substrate during physical activity has no relevance to 24-h substrate oxidation, energy expenditure, weight management, or body composition . High-intensity exercise depletes muscle glycogen stores and leads to higher postexercise fat oxidation . Conversely, low-intensity exercise with high fat oxidation is followed by increased postexercise carbohydrate oxidation, compared with a high-intensity exercise condition. This means that high fat oxidation during exercise is followed by low postexercise fat oxidation and vice versa. Total physical activity energy expenditure, regardless of the intensity, is therefore the important factor for weight management. However, intensity and the mode of exercise have some important consequences for health, which are briefly described in later sections on physical activity and metabolic health and on recommendations for physical activity and exercise.\n",

      "Exercise and leisure lifestyle activities are not necessarily associated. An individual may be an active exerciser but otherwise passive, or a nonsporty but lifestyle-active individual. Some individuals are active, or passive, in both behavioral domains. Unfortunately, only a few studies have analyzed the interactions among exercise, lifestyle activity, and obesity. Figure 29.4 shows the association between the two main domains of physical activity and the prevalence of obesity in 15 European Union countries . About 15,000 adults were divided into five groups according to the time spent in vigorous exercise and according to their leisure inactivity . Quintile 1 refers to those with the lowest levels of exercise or lifestyle inactivity, respectively.The most active combination was used as the reference category . As can be seen from the figure, those with no exercise activity and very high leisure inactivity had a fourfold increased prevalence of obesity. Low leisure inactivity , together with low exercise activity , was only associated with a doubling of obesity risk, compared to the fourfold increase in the extreme situation. In summary, the message of this cross-sectional study is that a combination of low lifestyle inactivity and high exercise activity is optimal for weight control. Being active in one of these domains is, however, clearly better than total inactivity.The main problem with cross-sectional evaluations is their inability to infer causality. Although randomized, controlled interventions are needed to show a cause-effect relationship, these kinds of designs are rarely practical in studying primary prevention of obesity. However, cohort studies or prospective follow-ups may bring additional insight to the role of individual health behavior or environment on weight change. A systematic analysis on the associations between physical activity and weight change has been carried out . This review identified 16 prospective, observationalThe outcomes were grouped according to when physical activity data were collected - that is, whether baseline, follow-up, or change in physical activity was compared against change in weight. Results from the studies using baseline physical activity data were inconsistent. Three studies reported that a large volume of physical activity predicted smaller weight change. High baseline work activity was associated with less weight gain in one study . In contrast, two studies reported that a large volume of vigorous physical activity at baseline was associated with greater weight gains . Finally, three studies did not find a significant association between baseline total physical activity or TV/VCR watching and the magnitude of weight change.The results with physical activity data at follow-up were more consistent: Four studies found that a large volume of physical activity or exercise at follow-up was associated with less weight gain. Only one study did not find such an association. Many studies used data on physical activity from baseline and follow-up. About half of the studies reported that an increase in physical activity was associated with less weight gain . In summary, this systematic analysis indicated that those who maintain or increase their physical activity also show the best weight control over a period of several years. Physical activity at baseline does not consistently predict weight change, perhaps because of changes in physical activity during the follow-up. Unfortunately, the prospective studies did not allow a two-dimensional analysis of physical activity .\n",

      "The effects of physical activity on weight reduction, without a concomitant low-energy diet, have been evaluated in a considerable number of studies . A meta-analysis identified 53 papers, published between 1950 and 1988, with randomized, controlled trials and with data on physical activity and changes in body composition. Dietary weight reduction programs were excluded. The average study length was approximately 17 weeks, except for studies with weight training . Males lost 1.3 kg body weight in trials with running or walking and 1.1 kg in trials with cycling. The respective fat-mass losses were greater for running/walking and cycling trials. Weight training resulted in a mean increase in body weight , but a reduction in fat mass . Results for females were more modest: Body mass or fat mass changed significantly only after running/walking , but not after cycling.Another systematic review identified ten studies, published between 1983 and 1995, with comparisons of exercise alone with no treatment in obese subjects. A third systematic review included studies with obese subjects, who were randomized into exercise and control groups. Combining these two reviews yields 18 studies. In short-term interventions , the mean weight reduction was 0.24 kg/week in exercising subjects and 0.05 kg/week in control groups . Long-term studies found only a 0.03 kg body mass reduction in exercising subjects and a 0.01 kg body mass increase in control groups .A reduction in energy intake may be regarded as a core method during weight reduction. The additional effects of a concomitant physical activity program on weight loss has been studied in several randomized, controlled interventions . A majority of the 19 studies identified by Wing did not find any statistically significant differences between exercise + diet vs. diet only. Nevertheless, when all short-term studies are pooled, the average weight loss was 0.1 kg/week greater in exercising subjects. In long-term studies , the mean difference was 0.02 kg/week favoring exercising subjects.Figure 29.5 combines the preceding two reviews . The open triangles represent studies using a diet only vs. exercise + diet design. The filled triangles indicate studies with exercise vs. control design. It is clearly visible that physical exercise leads to a beneficial outcome, but that the difference to the no-exercise group is modest in studies with a longer duration. The apparent reason for this discrepancy is poor long-term adherence to exercise programs.The largest improvement in weight reduction was achieved in studies with a rather high prescribed exercise level . However, a clear dose-response relationship was only observed for short term studies. It seems that the enhancement in weight loss is linear up to a prescribed energy expenditure of 2000 kcal per week. This energy expenditure level is achieved by walking briskly for 50 to 60 min/day or by jogging for approximately 30 min/day. Beyond this exercise level, the slope gets weaker. An apparent reason for this is that it becomes increasingly difficult to adhere to high-volume exercise prescriptions. In fact, it has been shownFIGURE 29.5 Difference in weight change between exercise vs. control or between diet + exercise vs. diet only , as a function of duration of the intervention. :S547-S552 and Ross, R. and Janssen, I. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2001; 33:S521-S527.)that less than 50% of the subjects with a target of 10 MJ/week or 2500 kcal/week energy expenditure during walking reached this goal. Similarly, less than 70% of the subjects with a 4.2 MJ/week goal reached this level . Other possible explanations are a reduction in physical activities other than the prescribed exercise program or an increase in the controls' physical activity .Figure 29.6 summarizes the results from a meta-analysis on the effects of exercise, with or without diet, on weight and body composition. The results concerning weight compare well with those presented previously . The inclusion of studies with body composition data brings some additional insight, however. It can be seen from the figure that the contribution of fat loss during diet-induced weight reduction is approximately 75% of the total weight loss. When aerobic exercise is used as the only means for weight reduction, the magnitude of weight reduction is modest but almost all is fat mass. Compared to diet, exercise improves the loss of visceral and subcutaneous fat . Moreover, when added to a weight-reducing diet, exercise spares about 1 kg of fat-free mass, but cannot prevent a loss of fat-free mass .Because the amount of energy expenditure is related to the total work done, it can be assumed that fractionization has no effect on weight change. Several studies have compared different kinds of walking prescriptions . The prescribed duration for physical activity was 90 to 200 min/week. As expected, fractionization had a similar effect on weight loss to that of exercising one longer bout daily.\n",

      "Weight maintenance after weight reduction is more difficult than initial weight loss . The effects of physical activity during weight reduction on weight loss maintenance have been examined in a systematic review . Eight studies were as randomized interventions with a prospective follow-up of at least 1 year's duration. The duration of weight reduction varied between 8 weeks and 12 months. Three studies used very low energy diet during the weight reduction phase; the other studies used a more conventional diet with restricted energy intake. All studies used aerobic exercise with a target duration of approximately 90 to 180 min/week.Only one study found clearly that exercise training during weight reduction led to less weight gain during the follow-up compared to nonexercising groups. In another study , weight regain was smallest in exercising subjects randomized to supportive telephone contacts during the follow-up. However, exercising subjects who were randomized to no extended support showed a tendency to regain even more weight than the diet-only subjects did. A third study reported better weight maintenance in one physical exercise group , but the finding was apparently caused by one outlier. In contrast to these results, four studies did not find exercise training to improve maintenance of reduced body weight . The weighed mean results of these eight studies suggested that exercise during weight reduction slowed weight regain by approximately 0.02 kg/week .The idea of introducing physical activity immediately after weight reduction as a maintenance intervention came originally from the group of Professor Michael Perri. In one of their studies , they used several weight-maintenance techniques, including aerobic exercise, in two groups All groups participating in the 6-month weight-maintenance intervention had less weight gain, compared with the controls who were not contacted after the weight reduction. Nevertheless, the exercise groups did not succeed any better or worse than the other weightmaintenance groups.In another weight-maintenance intervention , 67 participants were randomized into exercise-focused and weight-focused groups after a 6-month weight-reduction period. The exercising subjects met biweekly in supervised exercise sessions and were also trained in relapse prevention strategies to avoid or cope with lapses in exercise. The weight-focused group learned problemsolving of weight-related difficulties, without emphasis on physical activity. During the unsupervised follow-up , the exercise-group gained more weight than the weight-focused group.In our study , weight-reduced, but still overweight or obese, women were randomized into control, moderate-walking , and heavy-walking groups for a 9-month intervention period. All groups received diet counseling. Compared with the end of weight reduction, weight regain at the 2-year follow-up was 3.5 kg less in the moderate-walking group vs. control subjects. The heavywalking group did not differ from the controls.A more recent study investigated whether walking or resistance training after weight reduction prevents weight regain in males . A 2-month weight reduction by very low energy diet was followed by a 6-month weight-maintenance intervention and 23 months' unsupervised follow-up. Resistance training attenuated the regain of body fat mass during the intervention, but not during the follow-up. The walking subjects did not differ from controls.Several observational studies and post hoc analyses have shown a positive dose-response between the amount of physical activity and weight-loss maintenance . Some observational studies have estimated the amount of total exercise or walking , which is associated with improved weight-loss maintenance. The results are surprisingly similar: an average exercise energy expenditure of 9 to 10 MI/week , corresponding to walking 70 to 80 min/day, seems to be associated with stable weight after substantial weight reduction. These estimates concur with a recent expert panel recommendation . However, it should be noted that a smaller amount of walking may slow down, although not prevent, weight regain .In summary, the expected weight loss with 150 to 200 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise should be 2 to 3 kg in studies with 3 to 6 months' duration. The enhanced weight reduction when this exercise level is added to a weight-reduction diet is slightly less. Thus, 250 to 300 min/week seems more suitable for weight reducing purposes. This recommendation is close to the 45 min moderate-intensity exercise per day recommended in a recent report from an expert panel . Splitting the daily walking into multiple, shorter periods leads to a similar weight loss compared with walking an identical daily duration in one single period. For maintenance of reduced body weight, more than 60 min of moderate exercise per day after weight reduction might be needed.\n",

      "Physical activity has several beneficial effects on health . The general relationship among physical activity, obesity, and health is outlined in Figure 29.7. It is remarkable that most benefits of physical activity are also obtained through successful weight control. This means that physical activity may prevent cancer, cardiovascular heart diseases, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and several musculoskeletal disorders by improving weight control. However, as clearly stated in the preceding part of this chapter, many individuals may find it difficult to increase their physical activity to levels that are clearly related to improved weight control. Therefore, it is extremely important to appreciate other health benefits of physical activity. Another way of putting it: physical activity can prevent major chronic diseases by improved weight control and by other metabolic responses, independent of body weight.The next part of this chapter summarizes the most important dose-response issues related to physical activity and metabolic health. Those who want a deeper insight may read, for instance, the American College of Sports Medicine evidence-based dose-response symposium report . In many cases, \"dose\" refers to the total volume, or energy expenditure, of physical activity. However, energy expenditure is a function of training mode, intensity, frequency, and duration. Some of these subcomponents of total physical activity dose may be important for the health benefits.The American College of Sports Medicine dose-response report , together with another recent review , examined the long-term effects of aerobic exercise training and blood lipids. Both concluded that the effects of exercise training on LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are small. About half of the studies cited in these reviews reported a 5 to 20% increase in HDL-cholesterol concentration. A dose-response association between the prescribed volume of exercise and change in HDL-cholesterol concentration was not clear ; however, a threshold of 4.2 MI/week and 5 MI/week for a significant effect was suggested.A meta-analysis examined, among other factors, the effects of different exercise intensities on blood lipids. The intensity category had no effect on triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, the exercise-related decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration was more marked after high-intensity than after moderateintensity training. The results of the Studies on Targeted Risk Reduction Interven-tions through Defined Exercise support this conclusion : higher training volume was clearly related to beneficial effects on 12 indicators of lipid profile . Intensity had no clear effect on HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, or triglycerides; the high-intensity protocol was more beneficial on LDL-related measures.Judged from the preceding results, vigorous aerobic activities may be superior in decreasing LDL-cholesterol concentration, whereas intensity is not equally important for HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. A minimum intensity is much more difficult to identify. One recent study reported on the effects of an acute exercise bout on postprandial metabolism. The researchers had earlier found that a higher amount of moderate-intensity exercise was positively related to postprandial triglyceride clearance and insulin sensitivity. This time they used two exercise protocols with equal energy expenditure , but varying intensity . The subjects cycled for 90 or 240 min. Despite remarkable exercise energy expenditure and duration, the light-intensity bout did not have any effects on triglyceride clearance or insulin response to a fatty meal. In contrast, the moderateintensity exercise had a clear positive effect on both variables. These and some other data suggest that very light physical activities may not be effective in improving the metabolic profile, despite an increase in energy expenditure. However, more research is needed to clarify this important issue.Physical activity, even without weight loss, improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance . A meta-analysis of the effects on exercise, with or without diet, on type-2 diabetics included 12 aerobic training studies with duration between 8 to 52 weeks. The amount of prescribed exercise was 90 to 210 min/week in 11 studies, and 300 min/week in the remaining study. Exercise intensity was moderate. Using postintervention HbAn as the main outcome variable, the combined result was 0.66% units lower in the exercise groups compared with the nonexercise groups. Therefore, a clinically significant and positive response was observed. Weight loss in exercise groups was on average 1.7 kg larger in studies without dietary treatment and 0.9 kg larger in studies combining diet with or without exercise. These differences were not statistically significant. Although epidemiological data suggest that higher amounts of physical activity are related to lower incidence of type-2 diabetes, the data from controlled trials are insufficient to confirm a dose-response relationship . Exercise intensity is probably not very important for glucose tolerance, but the answer to this question is still unclear 84 .Physical activity lowers blood pressure immediately after an aerobic exercise session and as a response to long-term training . The response is associated with initial blood pressure; the blood-pressure-lowering effects of exercise are clearer in individuals with hypertension. Two recent reviews analyzed the effect of different exercise intensities on blood pressure. Both reviews concluded that the blood pressure response to moderate, in contrast to vigorous, physical activity may be more favorable. However, the data are not very conclusive and even vigorous physical activity is clearly better than inactivity.Obesity and high body weight have a beneficial effect on bone mineral mass and density. In contrast, obesity has a negative effect on many other musculoskeletal disorders, including muscle fitness and function, especially at older ages . Nevertheless, the potential importance of strength training in improving the general health and well-being of individuals with obesity has been undervalued. One reason for this could be the very small effects of strength training on body weight and the belief that strength training does not have a positive effect on metabolic health. The latter belief can be disputed. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials has shown that strength training leads to a 3-mm Hg decrease of systolic blood pressure in normo- and hypertensive individuals. Moreover, other studies have confirmed that muscle hypertrophy improves insulin sensitivity, even in subjects with normal glucose tolerance .The final issue is related to splitting the daily exercise dose, i.e., fractionization. Studies on fractionization have mostly used moderate-intensity physical activity . Based on the available data, splitting the daily dose into shorter segments has no apparent effect on blood lipids, blood pressure, or glucose metabolism. It is unclear whether the segments could be shorter than 10 min.Several mechanisms explain why physical activity is beneficial to metabolic health. Figure 29.8 outlines the best known effects of physical activity on short-term and long-term metabolism . Short-term responses include changes in transporter proteins , enzymes, and peripheral vascular resistance. Changes in oxygen delivery and utilization and in muscle crosssectional area are achieved only after several weeks of training. The loss of adaptation follows an inverse order: transporter protein and enzyme activities are lost rapidly, whereas improved vascularization and muscle size remain for some weeks even during inactivity .\n",

      "An interesting question is whether the set target level of walking should be higher than the actual target. The justification for this question is that the actual completed amount of physical activity is often lower than the prescribed amount. For instance, in one study , the \"high physical activity group\" had a target of exercise energy expenditure 10 MJ/week or walking approximately 70 min/day. Out of this group. less than 50% reached the target. In fact, 22% failed even to reach the \"low physical activity group\" target of 4.2 MJ/week or 30 min/day. Perhaps the prescribed amount could be 20 to 25% higher than the actual target. However, the individual should increase his or her exercise levels only gradually toward these goals.It has been suggested that the number of daily steps can be increased by 10% every 2 weeks, if the basic level is less than 8000 steps/day . It is not known how fast the amount of walking can be increased, but perhaps the change should not be more than 2000 to 2500 steps/day or 15 to 20 min/day during 2 months. An increase of twice this magnitude is needed for clear health benefits, so an efficacious and sustainable walking program may not produce significant results until several months have passed. It should be noted that the data are inadequate to tell whether, because of injury risks and/or poor physical fitness, obese individuals need to progress more slowly in increasing their levels of exercise.\n",

      "An important question is whether moderate physical activity is enough or whether more vigorous activity is needed for better weight control and health. As already discussed, the added impact of high-intensity activity on weight and insulin sensitivity seems negligible . High-intensity activity may have an additional positive effect on LDL-lipoproteins . Nevertheless, some cross-sectional studies show that a combination of high duration of walking activity and vigorous exercise activity is optimal for weight control and prevention of cardiovascular heart diseases . Moreover, individuals who are successful at long-term maintenance of substantial body weight loss expend almost 30% of their weekly physical activity energy in vigorous activities, such as running . Some high-intensity activities might simply be needed to increase the total energy expenditure up to efficacious levels. Perhaps walking or other moderate-intensity activities as the only mode of physical activity are too time consuming.\n",

      "Self-monitoring is a way to get immediate feedback. Pedometers are quite inexpensive and simple devices for monitoring the number of daily steps. Unfortunately, some pedometers give an unacceptably biased result, from an underestimation of 25% to an overestimation of 45% . Although systematic biases between pedometers are not very likely to affect monitoring of changes, it is important to be aware of potentially poor comparability between different devices. Accelerometers and heart-rate monitors with built-in equations for energy expenditure assessment are other possibilities for monitoring. However, a simple activity log may be as useful as these technical methods. Self-reporting is a potential weakness of an activity log, but the strength is that all kinds of activities are easily recorded. Cycling and gym training, for instance, are not accurately assessed by pedometers and accelerometers, and a heart-rate monitor is less precise in assessing light and very intense activities .Poor adherence to prescribed exercise is a great problem in weight-reduction interventions. After 4 to 6 months, increased physical activity levels typically return toward baseline. This is observed in studies with an unsupervised follow-up , as well as during biweekly group meetings . There is no panacea to increase long-term adherence to increased physical activity in obese individuals . Compared with group-based exercise, home-based exercise may improve long-term adherence . However, Andersen et al. did not find a difference in 1-year adherence between lifestyle activity vs. aerobics class groups. At present, the only advice would be to listen to the patient: some may find regular group meetings supportive, but others may prefer the time saved when walking from home. Moreover, it is important to tell the patient about difficulties in maintaining new activity habits.\n",

      "Epidemiological studies suggest that populations eating so-called traditional low-fat diets have a far lower incidence of many common forms of cancer than populations eating typical modern diets in industrialized nations. However, traditional diets have many other characteristics outside of their overall lower percent of energy from fat than diets eaten in industrialized nations to which they are compared. Among the differences are greater ingestion of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This difference in dietary pattern leads to a greater ingestion of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber and thousands of phytochemicals with cellular effects beyond antioxidation. In addition, the fibers from whole grains and lower intakes of red meat, sugar, added fat, and starch lead to reduced energy density of the diet, which has been shown to lead to satiety at a lower level of total calorie intake.In the U.S., the intake of hidden fats in processed foods has increased over the past 20 years. At the same time, the intake of high fructose corn syrup has increased from processed foods. The result of these trends has been an increase in overall energy intake, which, in the absence of increases in physical activity, predictably leads to an increase in body fat.\n",

      "Protein provides a stronger signal to the brain to satisfy hunger than carbohydrate or fat does and is needed for muscle deposition, which can increase the lean body mass that, in turn, raises resting metabolic rate. A number of amino acids, including tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, have been theorized to affect the hunger control mechanisms once they cross the blood-brain barrier. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, it has been suggested that single amino acids or small peptides enter the brain to elicit their effects. Also, the small differences in the rates at which proteins release their amino acids into the blood stream can affect satiety. Voluntary reduction in energy consumption has been noted in subjects consuming high-protein meals compared with highcarbohydrate meals when fed ad libitum.Researchers in the Netherlands have studied the effects of protein on hunger perceptions by studying subjects in a whole-body energy chamber under controlled conditions for over 24 hours. Subjects were divided into two groups and were fed isocaloric diets that were high-protein/high-carbohydrate or high-fat . Subjects reported significantly more satiety on the high-protein/high-carbohydrate diet, and hunger, appetite, desire to eat, and estimated quantity of food eaten were significantly lower. Less hunger was experienced during and after the high-protein meals. A higher diet-induced thermogenesis was also observed with the high-protein diet.Westerterp-Plantenga further investigated the effects of dietary protein on body weight maintenance after weight loss. After following a very low energy diet for 4 weeks, 148 male and female subjects were randomly assigned to receive diets with either 18 or 15% of total energy from protein, representing a 20% higher intake of protein in the additional protein group. During this 3-month maintenance period, those receiving additional protein showed a 50% lower body weight regain, only consisting of fat-free mass, with increased satiety and decreased energy efficiency .Another research team compared a high-protein diet to a control diet to evaluate weight loss over 27 weeks. Two groups of 25 moderately obese subjects were allowed to eat as much of either of two diets as they wanted. Weight loss and fat loss were significantly higher in the higher protein group, due to a reduction in daily calorie intake of approximately 16%.Another study comparing the effects of a high-protein, low-fat diet with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet reported that the higher protein diet improved utilization of body fat while maintaining lean body mass. This study concluded that the increased proportion of protein to carbohydrate had positive effects on body composition as well as on blood lipids, glucose homeostasis, and satiety during weight loss . A similar study comparing diets with 15 vs. 30% of calories from protein found that weight loss in the two groups was similar over the 6-week trial, but diet satisfaction was significantly greater in those consuming the higher protein diet .Brehm studied the effects of a very low carbohydrate diet and a calorie-restricted low-fat diet on body weight and heart disease risk factors in healthy women over a 6-month period. The very low carbohydrate diet group lost more weight and more body fat than the low-fat group. This study emphasized that the group with more weight loss was eating a low-carbohydrate diet; however, the protein content as a percentage of calories of the low carbohydrate diet was also much higher than that of the low-fat diet , which could also account for more weight loss due to increased satiety. In addition, the group eating more protein maintained a higher lean body mass while losing weight and a greater percentage of the weight that they lost came from excess body fat.A meta-analysis by Eisenstein et al. concluded that, on average, high-protein diets were associated with a 9% decrease in total calorie intake. The role of protein in affecting overall calorie intake and in body weight regulation in comparison to fat and carbohydrate needs further investigation. However, the evidence is strong that protein affects hunger-signaling mechanisms in the brain, induces thermogenesis, and contributes to the building and maintenance of lean body mass.\n",

      "It has been suggested that the increase in obesity in Western countries since 1900 may be related to changes in dietary fiber. Recommended fiber intakes of 20 to 35 g per day for healthy adults, and age plus 5 g per day for children, are not being met because intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes are below recommended amounts . Fiber-rich meals promote early satiety, are usually less calorie dense, lower in fat and added sugars than meals typical of a Western dietary pattern, and characteristic of a pattern to prevent and treat obesity.In clinical trials and observational studies, the intake of whole-grain foods, rich in fiber, is inversely associated with plasma biomarkers of obesity, including insulin. C-peptide, and leptin concentrations. Fiber-rich foods have a low glycemic index and glycemic load, resulting in lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels. In addition to promoting satiety due to their bulk, highfiber foods containing soluble fiber found in some fruits, oats, and barley may delay gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of macronutrients and may affect secretion of gut hormones to act as satiety factors.Few direct studies on the relationship between whole-grain intake and obesity have been undertaken, although several studies report an association between whole-grain intake and insulinsensitivity, which provides indirect support for the role of whole grains in body weight regulation. The relationship between obesity and fiber has been evaluated epidemiologically. Using food frequency questionnaires, obese men and women have been shown to have significantly more fat and less fiber in their diets than lean men and women . In a study of normal weight, moderately obese, and severely obese subjects, total fiber intake was higher in the lean than in the obese groups and the grams of fiber/1000 kcal were inversely related to body mass index .The association between dietary fiber intake and weight gain over time was examined in a prospective cohort study of over 74,000 female nurses. Their dietary habits were followed for 12 years and assessed and validated with food-frequency questionnaires. Women who consumed more whole grains consistently weighed less than those who consumed fewer whole grains; over the 12year period, those with the greatest intake of dietary fiber gained an average of 1.52 kg less body weight than those with the smallest increase in dietary fiber . Similar findings were reported in the Iowa Women's Health Study and the CARDIA study in which whole grain intake was inversely related to BMI after following subjects for 7 years . Epidemiological studies also report that whole-grain intake is protective against cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes and has diverse potential mechanisms, including antioxidation and mediation of insulin and glucose responses.The bulk of evidence suggests that dietary fiber decreases food intake and decreases hunger and that water-soluble fiber may be more efficient in this regard than water-insoluble fiber. Dietary fiber supplements lead to small weight losses greater than placebo. Although the weight loss obtained with dietary fiber is less than the 5% of initial body weight felt to confer clinically significant health benefits, the safety of dietary fiber and its other potential benefits on cardiovascular risk factors recommend it for inclusion in weight reduction diets.\n",

      "Due to its high-calorie density, a decrease in dietary fat has been a target in conventional approaches to weight loss. However, the relationship between dietary fat and obesity has been brought into question for several reasons. Weight loss on low-fat diets has been shown to be modest, and prospective epidemiological studies have not been able consistently to correlate dietary fat intake with weight. In addition, obesity prevalence in the U.S. has risen dramatically since the 1970s, despite a decrease in fat consumption as a percent of total energy and the increase in availability of reduced-fat or fat-free foods . Although dietary fat has decreased as a percentage of calories, carbohydrate consumption has increased; most of this increase has been in the form of refinedstarches and concentrated sweets with a high glycemic index and/or glycemic load. This has led to increased interest in the role of refined carbohydrates in the current obesity epidemic.In 1981, Jenkins et al. introduced the glycemic index as a system for classifying carbohydratecontaining foods based upon their effect on postprandial glycemia . In this system, the glycemic response to the ingestion of 50 g of available carbohydrate from the test food is compared to the response from the ingestion of 50 g of the reference food . This is expressed as the area under the glucose response curve for the test food, divided by the area under the curve for the standard, and then multiplied by 100.However, because the amount of carbohydrate in a typical serving of a given food will vary depending upon the food, the concept of glycemic load was introduced. This is an expression of the glycemic index of the food multiplied by the carbohydrate content of the food and takes into account the differences in carbohydrate content among foods . For example, a carrot has a relatively high glycemic index but, due to its low total carbohydrate content, has a low glycemic load. In general, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, and legumes have a low glycemic load.The intake of high glycemic index/glycemic load meals induces a sequence of hormonal changes, including an increased ratio of insulin to glucagon, that limit the availability of metabolic fuels in the postprandial period and promote nutrient storage . This in turn would be expected to stimulate hunger and promote food intake. Short-term feeding studies have demonstrated less satiety and greater voluntary food intake after consumption of high glycemic index meals as compared to low glycemic index meals.In one study of obese teenage boys, ad libitum food intake was measured for 5 hours following a low, medium, or high glycemic index lunch. Voluntary energy intake after the high glycemic index meal was 53% greater than after the medium glycemic index meal and 81% greater than after the low glycemic index meal . Similar outcomes have been seen in other single-meal studies - for example, demonstrating prolonged satiety after consumption of a low glycemic index bean puree vs. a high glycemic index potato puree .Weight loss on a low-calorie, reduced-fat diet may be enhanced if the diet also has a low glycemic index ; even when energy intake is not restricted, low glycemic index and/or low glycemic load diets have been shown to produce greater weight loss than conventional low-fat diets. Ebbeling et al. compared the effects of an ad libitum, reduced glycemic load diet with an energy-restricted, reduced-fat diet in obese adolescents and found significantly greater loss of weight and fat mass among subjects consuming the reduced glycemic load diet. At 12 months, mean BMI and fat mass had decreased significantly more in the low glycemic load experimental group compared with the conventional low-fat group.In another short-term study, 12 men with abdominal obesity were treated with an ad libitum low glycemic index, low-fat, high-protein diet or with a low-fat American Heart Association Step 1 diet consumed ad libitum to observe the nutritional and metabolic effects. Men on the low glycemic index diet, but not the low-fat diet, had a spontaneous 25% reduction in energy intake, with significant reductions in body weight and waist and hip circumference .Other data suggest that low glycemic index/glycemic load diets may confer protection against certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome, and type-2 diabetes. In the Women's Health Study, a high glycemic load dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk for colon cancer , and data from the Iowa Women's study indicated that a higher glycemic load pattern may be a risk factor for endometrial cancer incidence in nondiabetic women . In a study of 244 healthy women, a strong and statistically significant positive association was found between dietary glycemic load and plasma C-reactive protein, a plasma marker for chronic inflammation associated with an increased risk for heart disease . In large prospective epidemiological studies, the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the overall diet have been associated with a greater risk of type-2 diabetes in men and in women .\n",

      "Given that fat has more than twice the calorie density of carbohydrate or protein on a per-gram basis, the relationship between dietary fat and body weight has been of research interest for decades. Several reports have demonstrated a positive relationship between dietary fat intake and body weight ; however, others have noted a decrease in dietary fat as a percentage of calories with a higher overall calorie intake in the U.S. with increasing obesity in the population . Reports regarding the efficacy of low-fat diets to reduce body weight are inconsistent and, as yet, the role of dietary fat in the regulation of food intake is not fully understood. In short-term trials, a modest reduction in body weight is seen in individuals randomized to diets with a lower percentage of calories from fat.Randomized, controlled, ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate studies have demonstrated a range of weight loss in the range of 0 to 10 kg in the intervention groups, as compared to controls consuming their usual diet or a medium- to high-fat diet. Because of the large variability in outcome, the role of dietary fat in weight reduction has come into question. However, Bray and Popkin found that a reduction of 10% in the proportion of calories from fat was associated with weight loss of 16 g/day, or 2.9 kg over 6 months, based on 28 intervention trials.In a meta-analysis of ad libitum low-fat dietary intervention studies, Astrup et al. analyzed the relationship between initial body weight and weight loss. The analysis included data from 16 trials lasting 2 to 12 months and included 1728 individuals. Weight loss was positively and independently related to reduction in the percentage of calories from fat, although weight loss was not the primary aim of 12 of the 16 studies. It was concluded that ad libitum low-fat diets prevent weight gain in normal-weight subjects and consistently cause weight loss in overweight subjects . A longitudinal study in 54 postmenopausal women demonstrated that a very low fat diet consumed ad libitum over an 8-month period produced a mean weight loss of 8% and a 2.7% reduction in body fat .Obese individuals are at an increased risk for a number of diseases related to inflammation, and adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes a range in inflammatory mediators. Circulating concentrations of these cytokines are increased in obesity, and it has been shown that plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α are associated with obesity and decrease with weight loss . Abdominal obesity is specifically associated with increases in cytokine concentrations in addition to the effects of body weight and is one of the defining features of the metabolic syndrome.Human beings evolved on a diet with a favorable balance of ω-6:00-3 of approximately 4:1, but the current Western diet has a ratio estimated at 16.74 . The ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities; among the 0-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , those from fish oil are more biologically potent than 0-linolenic acid . Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies have indicated that ω-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.There are various sources of 0-3 and 0-6 PUFA in the diet. Green leafy vegetables and nuts are rich in α-linolenic acid , and the long-chain ω-3 PUFAs are found in fish oils such as salmon, mackerel, and herring. The ω-6 PUFAs occur mostly in the diet as linoleic acid and can be found in vegetable oils, with corn oil contributing the majority of lineoleic acid in the American diet.In animal studies, the anti-inflammatory effects of 0-3 PUFA have been demonstrated by the measurement of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 . Human ω-3 PUFA intervention studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease , and @-3 PUFA has been shown to alleviate symptoms of these diseases.Inflammation may be an important modulator of the relationship between obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The mechanisms through which obesity is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease may in part be mediated through inflammation. Some preliminary evidence now suggests that dietary w-3 PUFA can modulate at least some aspects of disease risk.\n",

      "Portion control is one of the primary strategies in calorie control. Many people do not take the time to weigh and measure foods or they may abandon this practice after a period of time, thinking that they can estimate portions fairly well. Typical diet plans specify what foods are to be consumed for meals and snacks, and portion sizes are usually specified in standard weights and measures. Practical problems may arise with patients, such as whether to weigh foods before or after cooking or failure to account for condiments or ingredients used in cooking.A few small mistakes over the course of a day or week can have a significant impact on weight loss progress. For example, an extra few ounces of meat could add an extra 200 cal to a day's intake, and calories in cereals range widely - from 50 to over 400 cal per cup. In restaurants, portions are almost always much larger than those specified on a meal plan, and fats and oils, sauces, dressings, gravies, and other high-fat ingredients are not always evident.Meal replacements are foods designed to take the place of a meal while at the same time providing nutrients within a known calorie limit. These can take the form of shakes, bars, soups, or frozen portion-controlled meals; they provide security to the patient due to a defined calorie and nutrient content. Meal replacements have been shown to produce weight loss results superior to calorie counting. In a study by Ditschuneit et al. , patients were divided into two groups: oneconsumed an all-food diet of between 1200 and 1500 cal per day and the other consumed two meal replacements as part of an overall diet plan of 1200 to 1500 cal.The all-food group lost approximately 3 lb over the first 12 weeks, and the meal replacement group lost approximately 17 lb. The markedly increased weight loss in the meal replacement group over the first 12 weeks was attributed to the enhanced dietary compliance mediated by the use of meal replacements. Both groups were then given one meal replacement per day over the course of 2 years and both groups lost additional weight. Ditschuneit and colleagues have shown that this approach can be maintained for up to 4 years .In a 1994 study, 300 men and women at six sites throughout the U.S. took two meal replacement shakes per day as part of a 1200-cal/day diet plan for 12 weeks. For the next 24 months, they consumed one shake per day as part of a 1200-cal diet plan. Weight loss was about 7% of the starting weight, and subjects who continued to the end of the study maintained much of their weight loss .Heymsfield et al. used primary data for meta- and pooling analyses from studies that compared partial meal replacement plans to reduced-calorie diet plans. Subjects prescribed the partial meal replacement or reduced-calorie diet treatment plans lost significant amounts of weight at the 3-month and 1-year evaluation time points; however, all methods of analysis indicated a significantly greater weight loss in subjects receiving the partial meal replacement plan compared to that in the reduced-calorie diet group. Additionally, the dropout rate for partial meal replacement and reduced-calorie diet groups was equivalent at 3 months and significantly less in the partial meal replacement group at 1 year.Recent research has demonstrated that, with the exception of fruits and vegetables, increased variety of intake in all categories of foods promotes obesity . By reducing variety, meal replacements help patients maintain a structured diet and portion control. Some meal replacements are excellent sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and may be superior to simply restricting conventional food intake if careful food choices, which would ensure nutritional adequacy, are not made.\n",

      "Obesity has been associated with low sympathetic activity and caffeine has been studied in animals and humans because it can increase sympathetic nervous system activity. In genetically obese mice without endogenous leptin production , caffeine has been shown to decrease body fat and improve sympathetic activity, suggesting a possible role in the treatment of human obesity . In a study of obese and lean humans acting as their own controls, caffeine in an oral dose of 250 mg increased free fatty acids and glucose, but not cortisol levels, compared to a water placebo . Increases in oxygen consumption and fat oxidation have been demonstrated in normal subjects given caffeine 8 mg/kg orally compared to 0.5 gm glucose, as well as in seven normal and six obese subjects after 4 mg/kg of caffeinated coffee compared to a decaffeinated control after fasting and after a mixed meal .In small studies, administration of caffeine has been shown to increase lipolysis, circulating fatty acid levels and oxygen consumption . In one study, caffeine administration significantly elevated systolic blood pressure 4.5 to 6.6 mm Hg, but diastolic blood pressure or pulse rate did not change ; subjects reported no symptoms or side effects. The increase in resting metabolic rate induced by 4 mg/kg of caffeine predicts the amount of weight lost in response to a diet and exercise program, and the dose-response characteristics have been carefully documented . Therefore, the scientific evidence in animals and humans supports a potential role for caffeine in weight reduction through increases in oxygen consumption and fat oxidation.Several epidemiological studies have addressed the safety of caffeine. The positive correlation found between heavy coffee drinking and elevated cholesterol is felt to be due to factors other than caffeine in coffee because caffeine consumption in the form of tea or cola has no effect on cholesterol . A clinical trial with 288 healthy subjects evaluated the effects of a single 200-mg/day dose of caffeine compared to placebo. Caffeine gave a 2.2 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure, which was felt to be clinically insignificant. Pulse rate or systolic blood pressure did not change. Similarly, in women, the negative effects on osteoporosis of drinking more than two cups of coffee per day are associated with factors other than caffeine in coffee . The FDA approves caffeine for sale without a prescription for use as a stimulant by persons 12 years of age or older at a dose up to 200 mg every 3 hours and as an ingredient in pain medications, which gives further support to its safety.\n",

      "Green tea prepared by heating or steaming the leaves of Camelia sinensis is widely consumed on a regular basis throughout Asia. However, the most widely consumed tea is the black tea consumed by more than 80% of the world's population . Black tea is made by allowing the green tea leaves to auto-oxidize enzymatically, leading to the conversion of a large percentage of green tea catechins to theaflavins. The catechins are a family of compounds including epigallocatechin gallate , considered to be the most potent antioxidant in the family of compounds. Drinking one cup of tea per day has been reported to decrease the odds ratio of suffering a myocardial infarction to 0.56 compared to that for those who do not drink tea .These compounds are flavonoids in the class of polyphenols and have many activities, including inhibition of the catechol-O-methyl transferase enzyme, which degrades norepinephrine . The catechins appear to be able to enhance sympathetic nervous system activity at the level of the fat cell adrenoreceptor. In vitro, a green tea extract containing catechins and caffeine was more potent in stimulating brown adipose tissue thermogenesis than equimolar concentrations of caffeine alone . The use of ephedrine to release norepinephrine increased the thermogenic effect noted with green tea catechins. Oolong tea or placebo was orally administered to mice over a 10week period during high-fat feeding. Mean food consumption was not different between the groups, but oolong tea prevented the obesity and fatty liver induced by the high-fat diet. Noradrenalineinduced lipolysis was shown to increase and pancreatic lipase activity to be inhibited by the oolong tea .Because caffeine occurs naturally in green tea extract, it has been difficult to separate the effects of green tea from caffeine in humans. However, a study by Dulloo et al. gave subjects green tea extract capsules, three times per day, providing a total of 150 mg caffeine and 375 mg total catechins, of which 270 mg was epigallocatechin gallate. Subjects spent three 24-hour periods in an energy chamber during which they received the green tea extract. 150 mg of caffeine, or placebo. In the 24 hours when green tea was administered, 24-hour urinary excretion of norepinephrine but not epinephrine was noted compared to the caffeine or placebo-treatment periods. Energy expenditure was higher by 4.5% in the green tea period compared to placebo and 3.2% higher than when the same dose of caffeine was given alone. In addition, fat oxidation was increased. The net effect attributable to green tea could be estimated at 328 kJ/day or approximately 80 cal/day. Clearly, it is difficult to demonstrate the effects of green tea catechins alone, but a synergistic interaction with ephedrine independent of the caffeine content of green tea is possible and should be evaluated.\n",

      "Capsaicin from chili peppers and red peppers has been shown to stimulate fat oxidation and thermogenesis . The exact mechanism for this effect is not known, but the constituents appear to activate neural signals that result in vasodilation and endorphin release. Ohnuki et al.have investigated the effects of capsiate, a nonpungent capsaicin analog found in the fruits of a nonpungent cultivar of pepper, CH-19 Sweet, on oxygen consumption and fat accumulation in mice. Capsaicin as well as capsiate increased oxygen consumption and serum adrenalin levels vs. controls. Additionally, after the administration of capsaicin and capsiate for 2 weeks, capsiate suppressed body-fat accumulation as well as capsaicin vs. control.The effects of the same cultivar were tested in humans in whom core body temperature, body surface temperature, and oxygen consumption were measured after ingestion of CH-19 or a control pepper that contained neither capsaicin nor capsiate. The core body temperature and forehead temperature were higher in the CH-19 group vs. control, and body surface temperature increased for approximately 20 minutes after consumption of the CH-19. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher in the CH-19 group, suggesting that the nonpungent cultivar increased thermogenesis and energy consumption .Tsi et al. studied the combined effect of capsaicin, green tea extract, and essence of chicken vs. placebo on body-fat content in healthy overweight subjects. The supplement contained 0.4 mg capsaicin, 625 mg green tea extract, and 800 mg essence of chicken. Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary and exercise habits and, after 2 weeks, showed a decrease in mean body fat percentage and an increase in resting energy expenditure in the treatment group compared to controls .\n",

      "In clinical intervention trials of low-fat diets designed to test the ability of nutrition to affect cancer incidence, the total caloric intake has not changed significantly due to the continued and increased intake of refined carbohydrates in compensation of lower fat intake. Typically, in studies such as the Women's Health Initiative, overall mean changes in body weight have been small, reflecting little change in overall energy intake or balance. Similarly, high-protein diets based on increased animal protein intake with controlled intakes of refined carbohydrates have not led to sustained reductions in body weight.There are a number of strategies for affecting the overall dietary pattern while restricting energy intake through calorie restriction. The control of energy balance will continue to be of interest to those studying the relationship between obesity and cancer. Overweight increases the risk for several cancers, including esophageal, colorectal, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancers, and maintenance of healthy body weight and avoidance of weight gain in adulthood are advised. Further research into strategies for cancer prevention and the role of energy balance control is critical, given the current national epidemic of obesity.\n",

      "The case for physical inactivity as an important lifestyle risk factor for several site-specific cancers as well as other chronic diseases is now well established. Although research into the preventive health benefits of physical activity commenced as early as the 1950s , it has been only in recent years that the body of evidence has positioned inactivity as a major public health issue. In 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 million deaths and 19 million disability adjusted life years were attributable to inactivity . Conservative calculations estimate that 10% of breast cancer and 16% of colon cancer worldwide could be attributed to physical inactivity alone . These are similar to other estimates; Mezzetti et al. estimated that 11% of breast cancer risk and Slattery et al. estimated that 13% of colon cancer risk could be attributable to physical inactivity. It is, however, likely that all these estimates grossly underestimate the true magnitude of burden due to physical inactivity because of the wide variation in measurement used and the unaccounted-for contribution of physical inactivity to increased body mass .The economic cost of low levels of activity is also being recognized despite the measurement difficulties. Recent estimates suggest that, in the U.S., physical inactivity alone contributes as much as $75 billion to U.S. medical costs , and costs associated with inactivity and obesity accounted for 9.4% of the national health expenditure . In Canada, physical inactivity is estimated to cost about 2.5% of the direct total health care expenditures; a 10% reduction in inactivity has the potential to reduce these costs by $150 million . In England, total costs of inactivity due to the direct costs of treatment for major lifestyle diseases and the indirect costs through sickness absence has been estimated to be £8.2 billion a year .The public health response to physical inactivity has varied widely around the world. Several countries, notably Canada and Finland, have implemented major national initiatives for well over two decades ; however, for others, public health involvement and action at national and state/regional levels is much more recent. In 2002, the World Health Organization commenced the development of a global strategy on physical activity, diet, and health and this was endorsed by the member states in 2004 . This reflects the growing recognition by government and nongovernment organizations of the role of physical activity in reducing noncommunicable disease and their need to help address levels of inactivity in the whole population. Evidence-based reviews of effectiveness of interventions have proliferated in response and these summaries of what is known to work can assist governments in prioritizing their actions. Growing awareness of the trends in overweight and obesity, evidence of chronic disease in young children and adolescents, rates of urbanization, and changing patterns of transportation have helped accelerate the agenda for population-based programs aimed at physical activity. Media interest also has focused attention on these issues so that, now, countries around the world are beginning to take the importance of active lifestyles across the life course much more seriously.This chapter provides a summary of the evidence base for public health action, an overview of the principles and content of a population-based approach, and a review of selected initiatives. This includes examples of communication campaigns, efforts aimed at creating supportive environments, programs in different settings, and a summary of recent developments in the policy arena. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive review of all intervention research on physical activity, nor is it needed. Interested readers are referred to other recent reviews mentioned earlier for critiques of interventions aimed at specific settings and populations.\n",

      "A population-based approach involves thinking in aggregate terms rather than as individuals, which is more familiar to physicians and clinicians. The approach recognizes the multiple determinants of health and their complex interactions that affect health status and involves implementing strategies that address the entire range of factors that determine health. A population approach also includes identifying vulnerable populations and directing efforts to address the differences in health status between groups within populations. More recently, the pressing need to accelerate understanding of and intervention on the social, behavioral, economic, and political inequalities that generate health inequalities is being recognized .The underlying principles of a population health-based approach in practice include a strong commitment to working in partnership with communities and other organizations, the use of the best available evidence for action, and a focus on achieving sustained action and investment in long-term health outcomes . In practice, a population-based approach comprises universal strategies aimed at all people and targeted programs for those who are most vulnerable . The latter aims at addressing the identified gaps in health status between subgroups in the population.\n",

      "The role of physical activity in the prevention of specific cancers has received considerable attention in recent years . Overall, the findings are consistent. Colon cancer risk decreases with increased levels of physical activity. The risk reduction for physically active men and women is around 30 to 40%, compared with that for inactive people . Although the evidence base on the exact amount of activity required is modest, it appears that 30 to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise is required to decrease risk . Furthermore, a dose-response relationship is apparent, with risk declining with higher levels of activity. Available evidence indicates that physical activity is not associated with a reduced risk of developing rectal cancer .There is clear evidence on the preventive effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk. Physically active women have about a 20 to 30% reduction in risk compared with inactive women . It appears that 30 to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise is required to decrease the risk of breast cancer and that a dose-response relation probably occurs . These associations have been reported for pre- and postmenopausal women and in studies measuring total activity, fitness, and levels of walking.No consistent evidence on an association between physical activity and endometrial, prostate, testicular, ovarian, or lung cancers has been found . Further research is required to understand the possible associations with these cancers as well as to clarify the dose-response relationship between specific cancers and different types of activity. The most recent evidence suggests that more intense activity, and increased frequency and duration of activity, may provide more protection. Although physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cancer, the mechanisms are still being investigated.This brief summary of research indicates a substantial evidence base underpinning the need for a coordinated agenda of action at the population level to increase levels of physical activity for the prevention and treatment of cancer. For more comprehensive coverage of the evidence, readers are directed to other chapters in this volume and recent reviews .\n",

      "Nationally representative data on levels of participation in physical activity are available from less than one third of the countries . Although most countries in Western Europe, along with North America, Australia, and New Zealand, have such data, in many other countries data are available only from selected regions or cities or not at all. Significant efforts to improve the assessment of key risk factors of cancer and chronic disease, including physical inactivity, are under way internationally and regionally . The development of measurement instruments and methods as well as the central collation of risk factor data worldwide are supported by the World Health Organization. At a regional level, the first data on inactivity from several countries in South and Central America are now available .The ability to track trends in risk factors over time has been hampered by the use of different measures and this is particularly true for levels of inactivity. However, again only in recent years, a concerted effort has been made to increase consistency between surveys and, when possible, comparability between countries. The international physical activity questionnaire and the global physical activity questionnaire are two different instruments developed for use as a brief assessment tool in population health monitoring systems. They provide overall and domainspecific estimates of activity, respectively .In countries with data, notably the more advanced economies, the current pattern of participation is of great concern. In the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, less than half of the adult population achieve the current recommended levels of at least 150 minutes of activity per week. The proportion of adults reporting no physical activity can range from 15% in Australia to 80% in Brazil . Few countries have good trend data; however, where they are available, the results show mostly declining levels of activity or at best no change .Low levels of activity in many countries are of concern, as are notable differences between subgroups within the population. In general, findings from the national surveys show that levels of activity are highest for younger adults , but this declines sharply with age. Men are more likely than women to meet current recommended levels of activity, although it is known that these differences can disappear when different domains and types of activity are assessed. Adults with higher educational attainment are more likely to be more active compared with those with lower levels of education. However, this is seen most often with measures of leisuretime activity and may also diminish if other types of activity, such as transport-related activity and home-based activities, are included.\n",

      "Increased levels of participation in physical activity through a population-based approach comprising initiatives aimed at reaching everyone in the community, combined with targeted programs in selected settings to reach specific subpopulations based on need and inequalities, has considerable potential. Recent reviews have examined the effectiveness of various intervention approaches . Furthermore, at least two ongoing systematic review processes are under way, one in the U.S. under the guidance of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services and the other in the U.K. as part of the Health Development Agency's Evidence and Guidance Collaborating Centre work program . The most recent recommendations from the work completed in the U.S. are shown in Table 31.1. Six of the eleven interventions reviewed to date are recommended for widespread implementation.It is widely recognized that no single strategy or intervention will produce large changes in population levels of an activity. Instead, it is necessary to implement a coordinated, comprehensive set of strategies for investment over the medium to long term. Like other lifestyle risk factors, patterns of individual and population levels of activity are difficult to change, and isolated, shortterm quick fixes will not be sufficient.A successful comprehensive approach to increasing physical activity requires action at the policy level combined with program interventions and a supportive environment. Gaining political and professional support as well as necessary community awareness and engagement is needed and can be achieved through the use of mass media combined with strategic lobbying and public relations activities. The need to create healthy public policy and the need for increased provision of programs require action in areas outside the health sector ; therefore, it is particularly important that a comprehensive approach be undertaken in partnership with relevant government and nongovernment agencies and community groups. For instance, after-school activity programs may require the combined efforts of public and private education authorities, schools, teachers, parents, sport and recreation services, and local or municipal government.\n",

      "Although the development of national policy on physical activity is a relatively new endeavor, several countries have a policy in place or under development. This has been strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization in its Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health . A national policy on physical activity has been defined as... a formal statement that defines physical activity as a priority area, states specific goals and provides a specific plan or framework for action. It describes the procedures of institutions in the government, nongovernment and private sectors to promote physical activity in the population and should define the accountability of the involved partners.A recent comparative study of several emerging national policies in 13 countries revealed a number of similarities in their approaches. For example, intersectoral consultation and partnership were considered an integral part of policy development process; multiple individual-oriented behavior change interventions and, to a lesser extent, environmentally focused interventions were proposed in various combinations. Leadership for policy development and coordination was usually within health or/and sport departments. Although links to other policies such as healthy nutrition and obesity were evident, connections to transport and environmental policies were less developed . Notable gaps were present in policies in terms of specifying timeframes and accountabilities for implementation and no evidence of long-term funding to support implementation. To date, national policy on physical activity is rare and the most recent developments have yet to be evaluated.\n",

      "The role of the environment on individual behavior has long been recognized in theories of health behavior , but it is only in the past 5 years that it has become a major focus for those working on increasing levels of physical activity. In contrast, the development of behavioral interventions aimed at individuals in different settings has received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. However, a prominent paradigm shift has occurred and now researchers and practitioners are keenly interested in defining, understanding, and ultimately influencing the design of buildings, neighborhoods, and whole communities to create places that support engaging in physical activity . This shift toward influencing the places in which people live and work has the potential to reach all members of the population and represents a real shift from the clinical -based model of health promotion and disease prevention to a truly population health-based approach.The scale of interest in the role of the physical environment varies. Patterns of use of stairs in buildings have received attention along with simple interventions aimed at increasing use ; these have proved to be quite successful in the short term . The design of parks and public open space is also being explored - in particular, to understand and increase the provision of safe places for children to play -because of their potential to provide opportunities for active recreation and leisure for adults and improve public health . On an even larger scale, the relationship between transportation systems and concomitant infrastructure has attracted interest at the city or metropolitan regional level .Despite the explosion of interest in the environment, understanding and empirical evidence are still at the formative stage of development. This is frustrating for practitioners who want to know today where to invest effort and resources and what urban design interventions represent the best buy. Sigmificant progress has been made on the measurement challenges of this new field and some of the early findings across a variety of studies are consistently showing that density of population, level of traffic, proximity to destinations and the aesthetic nature of the local environment are associated with higher levels of physical activity.It is also apparent that the physical attributes of an environment that influence participation may differ for different subgroups and for different behaviors. In other words, what influences a young mother and child to walk to school will differ from what influences an older person to walk for recreation and a young man to cycle for fitness. These differences require future research to target specific behaviors in specific environmental contexts . Meanwhile it remains too early for definitive advice on what interventions are more or less effective.Although this is a new field, there are examples of initiatives aimed at improving the physical and social environment in different countries and at least one review . Interventions aimed at increasing the use of stars and walking trails have been tested. In the U.S., trails have been built in local communities in southern Missouri, a deprived rural region. These have been built in partnership with the local communities and, in some cases, with private sector sponsorship; the results have shown increased levels of walking .Large-scale changes to the urban environment are neither easy to gain support for nor quick to do. Moreover, they are usually costly. Therefore, it is recommended that these be undertaken opportunitistically and that they capitalize on the shared concerns within governments and in communities around issues with potential synergy with physical activity , such as: improving air quality, reducing traffic and noise pollution, attracting business and building the economy, and enhancing the sense of community . All these agendas share a common goal — namely, contributing to the improvement of quality of life and quality of a community. Increasing physical activity can be used to bring seemingly disparate groups and agendas together.\n",

      "Many powerful and interacting forces in the current social and cultural environment have an impact on the physiological traits of individuals. The ability to maintain sufficient levels of physical activity successfully in order to counterbalance the excess of energy intake in modern society is a challenging proposition for many, if not most, of us. As a result, excess body weight is no longer the exception; rather, because more than 65% of the population is currently defined as overweight, it has become the norm . Due to their increasing prevalence, overweight and obesity may be the most common conditions encountered in the primary care setting. However, patients are not visiting the clinic for their obesity per se. Because excess weight is so strongly associated with a host of medical conditions, many patients are seen in the primary care setting for treatment of obesity-related sequelae .Primary care practitioners can support their patients in a variety of ways to address the challenges of dealing with overweight and obesity. Control of body weight depends upon a balance between food consumed and energy expended in the context of the natural tendency of the body to accumulate body fat. Thus, clinicians can help raise awareness of the importance of healthy nutrition and physical activity, motivating their patients to take action and facilitating access to appropriate programs.It is the purpose of this chapter to consider the opportunity that resides within primary care to address overweight and obesity through physical activity and diet. It will discuss the clinical burden associated with obesity in the context of administrative and operational challenges and financial realities of clinical practice that call for extended care teams, identification of patients, counseling and referral tools, and effective operational clinic systems. A discussion of specific content related to diet and physical activity recommendations appropriate for weight loss and weight maintenance is beyond the scope of this chapter because they have been addressed in other chapters.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity are recognized as major public health concerns in the U.S. and many other countries. Since the mid-1980s, overweight and obesity rates have steadily increased among children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Based on measured height and weight among a representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. civilians, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey studies have monitored the prevalence of overweight and obesity since 1960 . Current estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults using NHANES 1999-2002 data are outlined in Table 32.1.Among adults and children , the prevalence of overweight in 2002 was 65.7 and 16.5%, respectively . In addition, obesity rates among lowincome adults are estimated to be almost twice as high compared to those of adults with higher incomes; rates are disproportionately high among African American and Latino women. Whereas the increase in prevalence of obesity has been rapid over the past two decades, the increase in prevalence of severe obesity ≥40 kg/m2) has outpaced all other classes of obesity. Between 1986 and 2000, the prevalence of severe obesity quadrupled from a rate of about 1 in 200 to 1 in 50, compared to a doubling in the prevalence of obesity rates of a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater .\n",

      "The clinical burden associated with overweight and obesity has been well documented by numerous studies. One of the most compelling examples is the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which appears to be on a parallel track with the rising rates of overweight and obesity . Indeed,its prevalence in obese adults is three to seven times that in normal-weight adults. Those with a BMI > 35 kg/m² are 20 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to those with a BMI in a healthy range . However, overweight and obesity are associated with several other medical concerns as well.\n",

      "In addition to type 2 diabetes mellitus, excess weight has been associated with increased risks of metabolic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance . Increased risk for cardiovascular disease is related to the association between excess weight and increases in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen in adults and children . In addition, overweight and obesity have been linked to increased risks of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, osteoarthritis, gallbladder disease, and several types of cancer including cancer of the breast, endometrium, colon, kidney, esophagus, stomach, and gallbladder . Some studies have also reported links between obesity and cancers of the prostate, ovaries, and pancreas , although these relationships remain unclear.\n",

      "The relationship between obesity and medical conditions has a significant impact on primary care as evidenced by data from Quesenberry and colleagues , who reported on health care utilization rates according to BMI categories among members of a large health plan. Significant utilization rates were related to inpatient and outpatient services for BMI categories ≥ 30 kg/m². In addition, this study showed a direct effect of obesity on inpatient, pharmacy, laboratory, and outpatient costs. The burden of obesity is economic as well as clinical.The overall economic impact of obesity on health care expenditures is clearly substantial. Colditz presented data based on prevalence statistics of obesity derived from NHANES III that estimated the direct costs of obesity to be around $70 billion, or approximately 7% of the total health care costs for the U.S. Quesenberry and associates had also estimated the total health care expense related to obesity for the health plan and reported it to be approximately 6% of total health plan costs.Although total costs associated with obesity are high, excess charges appear to be incurred in a short timeframe as well. In a series of studies, Pronk and colleagues reported on the excess health care costs associated with obesity among older health plan members aged 40 years and over and active employees aged 18 to 65 years, and finally the indirect costs related to decrements in productivity that are associated with obesity. First, they studied the relationship between modifiable health risks and short-term health care charges in a random sample of older adult health plan members . Results indicated that, after adjustment for age, sex, race, and chronic disease status, each BMI unit was prospectively related to 1.9% higher charges. In other words, for each incremental unit of BMI, excess health care charges increased by 1.9% during the course of the year.Next, among active employees, the annualized health care costs associated with excess weight were studied based on BMIs calculated from self-report health assessment surveys . In a sample of 8822 employees, after statistically controlling for age, sex, asthma, breast cancer, other cancers, diabetes, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, back pain, lung disease, and emotional and physical function, average health care costs for overweight and obese employees were 8% higher per year.Finally, a study was conducted to examine the association between obesity and work performance, or productivity . Work performance was considered in the absenteeism and \"presenteeism\" domains - that is, work loss days as well as decrements in performance among employees while at work. Obesity was significantly related to work loss days as well as an interpersonal relationship variable expressed as \"getting along with coworkers.\" Due to these studies, it isconcluded that obesity increases not only direct medical care expenses, but also the indirect costs associated with reduced productivity due to decrements in work performance.\n",

      "It is important to determine whether advice to lose weight through diet and physical activity results in an improvement of health status and management of associated medical conditions. Based on a variety of studies , it appears that modest weight loss and increases in physical activity are associated with a significant reduction in disease-related risks. Table 32.2 presents a summary of the positive impact that weight loss and physical activity increases have on a variety of diseases and chronic conditions. Detailed information on the recommendations to follow regarding physical activity and weight management is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, the following statement, as put forth by Blair et al. , represents advice supported by current knowledge that fits with clinical approaches to implement preventive counseling guidelines based on systematic reviews of scientific literature:Current public health recommendations for physical activity are for 30 min of moderate-intensity activity/d, which provides substantial benefits across a broad range of health outcomes for sedentary adults. This dose of exercise may be insufficient to prevent unhealthful weight gain for some, perhaps many, but probably not all, persons. For persons who are exercising 30 min/d and consuming what appears to be an appropriate number of calories, but are still having trouble controlling their weight, additional exercise or caloric restriction is recommended to reach energy balance and minimize the likelihood of further weight gain. For persons exercising 30 min/d who are weight stable, we recommend that they try to build up to 60 min activity/d, which will provide additional benefit. In addition to aerobic\n",

These additional exercises will promote maintenance of lean body mass, improvements in muscular strength and endurance, and preservation of function, all of which enable long-term participation in regular physical activity and promote quality of life.The basic elements of effective weight reduction and weight management include dietary changes that produce a reduction in energy intake, increased physical activity, and behavior modification . Long-term maintenance of weight loss is strongly associated with sustained increased physical activity, normalized eating patterns, a healthful diet low in fat content, and the adoption of specific behavioral strategies strongly related to problem-solving mastery . For example, in a cross-sectional study of individuals who had maintained a 30-lb weight loss for at least 5 years, over 80% had adopted behavior changes in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, and the use of specific behavioral strategies .\n",

      "As outlined by the Institute of Medicine , a chasm exists between the care patients deserve and the care patients receive in the U.S. today . In order to transform the care provided to patients, the Institute of Medicine has proposed several recommendations, including one in which all health care organizations, professional groups, and private and public purchasers should pursueHow to help a patient move to the open the manus and the manus and the man propriate, and fective. Help tient focus on pla rovide positi support six major aims: specifically health care should be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable, and patient centered. The patient-centeredness aim is particularly salient to the issue of obesity because it has been observed that gaps remain in the way in which physicians and other clinicians provide medical care services to obese patients. As defined by the Institute of Medicine , patient centeredness relates to providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , approximately 29% of men and 44% of women are trying to lose weight. Furthermore, among men who consider themselves to be overweight or obese, 36 and 60% are trying to lose weight, respectively. Among women who consider themselves to be overweight or obese, 60 and 70% are trying to lose weight. Even among those who consider themselves to be at a weight that is about right for them. 7% of men and 27% of women are trying to lose weight. Although the combination of diet and physical activity is the preferred method for weight loss, most attempt to lose weight by diet alone, fewer by physical activity alone, and even fewer use the combination.Patients tend to value the interaction with their physician highly; often they view their primary care physician as a \"trusted guide.\" However, in the context of addressing obesity, the studies appear to be equivocal. Overweight patients were significantly less satisfied with the care that they received for obesity and with the physician's expertise in this area compared to the care that they received in the areas of their general health or medical needs, as well as their physician's expertise in these other areas of medicine and health . Among the reasons cited, 50% of patients reported that their physician had not mentioned any of ten common weight loss methods; 65% of patients reported a lack of understanding on the physician's part about the difficulty of being overweight; and about 35% indicated that the doctor did not believe them when they talked about their food consumption. More worrisome findings included the reporting of overweight and obese patients' feelings that they were treated with disrespect by their health care providers based on their weight status .On the other hand, patients also report the importance of feeling that their physician helps them in achieving their weight-related goals. Dietary advice, help in setting realistic goals, and exercise recommendations are among the most appreciated reasons for advice . Yet, the denial of a patient's weight problem or the avoidance of addressing the issue of obesity by the physician is not appreciated by the patient at all. Patients want to discuss their obesity-related issues with their physician and would like more rather than less physician involvement; however, almost two-thirds of patients report that their physician did not bring up the subject at their last visit .It is clear that the patient wants to be supported by the primary care physician in attempts to address concerns about excess weight. However, it appears that, in general, advice is often lacking and the approach taken to address weight-related issues may not be the most empathetic or respectful in some cases. A more thoughtful and systematic method of including this topic in the arsenal of clinical tools and strategies for dealing with patient care may be needed.\n",

      "Despite best intentions, the integration of counseling for diet, physical activity, and excess weight into clinical care is below par. The reality of busy clinic schedules, limited time for a physician to spend time with the patient, the issue of financial reimbursement, and other reasons result in missed opportunities to talk to patients about taking action on these modifiable adverse health risks . It is also unlikely that physicians will ever have more time to devote to counseling for health behaviors due to the high cost of physician time and the time pressures under which they do their work .Therefore, a promising approach is to consider how best to extend the reach of the primary care physician into an extended care team that is inclusive of nurses, but also dietitians, exercise physiologists, health educators, and behavior change counselors. This approach would require an office-based system that may be viewed as a recognizable organized process supporting the systematic delivery of counseling and interventions that address obesity, nutrition, and physical activity . Such systems should not be limited to the clinics, but extend beyond the clinic walls and employ multiple technologies, including mail, telephone, and Web-based solutions .\n",

      "Creating a system, or organized process, around the provision of effective obesity care that operates efficiently on a day-to-day basis is extremely important. Such a system should be integrated and be designed around a patient care team that places the patient's needs at the core of its work. Because teamwork needs coordination, delegation of tasks, and ongoing feedback, key steps and referrals and hand-offs need to be delineated and systematized so that they may be documented, tracked, and monitored to allow for continuous improvement. Starfield defines a patient care team as \"a group of diverse clinicians who communicate with each other regularly about the care of a defined group of patients and participate in that care.\" Such teams ensure that all elements of care are performed competently .The optimal team composition is also important to consider and will certainly vary among practices. The physician should be positioned as the team leader and source of the common philosophy of care based on the notion that critical success factors include physician commitment and leadership and a supportive organizational structure . Prior to patient-physician clinical interaction, however, support staff plays a role in meeting and greeting the patient and setting the tone for the visit. Registered nurses review the patient chart and obtain vital signs that should include height and weight measurement. In a paper-based practice, height and weight can be converted easily into BMI with the use of BMI charts; in practices that employ electronic medical records, the BMI can be calculated immediately as preprogrammed into the computer applications. Alternatively, BMI information may be already available if the patient had a chance to complete a more in-depth assessment of health risks behaviors such as a health risk appraisal. The nurse may also include additional measurements, such as the waist circumference.Armed with this information, which completes the first of the 5As, the physician has a chance to initiate a dialogue with the patient, provide advice, and gain agreement for action. In a typical, busy clinic schedule, the physician has approximately 1 minute available to address preventionrelated topics ; thus, a referral to another member of the extended care team should be made to do the \"assist\" and \"arrange\" for follow-up. This referral may be made to a clinical registered dietitian or to a centralized service that provides the counseling needed to support behavior changes. The health professionals in such a centralized program include registered dietitians, health educators, counseling psychologists, pharmacists, and exercise physiologists. Few examples of such systems are available in the literature, although some are emerging .\n",

      "As discussed earlier, the integration of such organized preventive systems is important. Integration of documentation of the patient data, referrals, action steps taken, program participation, results and outcomes, and evaluation data, and the tracking of such data in robust databases can create efficient office-based systems. To do this effectively, systems designs should optimize the use of interactive technologies. Interactive technology approaches have great potential to enhance primary care behavior change counseling and support . Computer-based strategies can help clinicians to \"systematize\" repetitive aspects of practice, such as repeated assessments and identification of individual goals. In addition, they can help avoid systematic errors in the process by consistently following a predetermined pathway of actions. Such approaches can be integrated into the visit process and result in more consistent implementation of the 5As.\n",

      "A combination of clinic-based resources and the use of an extended care team that includes resources available for \"between visit care\" may well be an optimal form of treatment design because most of the behavior changes will happen outside the clinic walls. Figure 32.2 depicts a protocol that combines the in-clinic \"assess.\" \"advise\", and \"agree\" steps of the 5As with the \"assist\" and \"arrange\" steps that may be provided by an extended care team. This team includes allied health professionals associated with the clinic and the physician but located in a centralized department, such as a health plan health education department or a contracted vendor arrangement. The clinic personnel, including the nursing staff and the physicians, stay connected with the behavior change staff using interactive technology such as a secure Website, telephone, and fax. The use of a Website is of interest because physicians and their nursing team can be provided access to a portion of the site specific to their patient only. At the time of the next visit, the patient's records can be reviewed and advice can be tailored to progress in the treatment program.This type of approach is used by the National Center for Lifestyle Management project as implemented by the Health Partners Health Behavior Group . This project utilizes a secure Website that houses a physician-training program and referral and documentation information for patients referred to a telephone-based intervention for weight management that has a walking program integrated in its curriculum. The training module presents an overview of the problem of obesity in the U.S. that also provides Continuing Medical Education credit when completed. In addition, clinical staff can use the Website to refer patients into the phone course.The physician or nurse enters key information into the Website that allows the centralized NCLM staff to contact the patient proactively. Once the staff member connects by phone with the patient, a choice is available to enroll in the program or — based upon more detailed information regarding learning style and other interests - a match can be made to an available communitybased resource that has previously been identified by clinic staff. Because the referrals are made following the \"agree\" step in the 5As process, the enrollment rate into the phone-based program is relatively high based upon early results of the project - i.e., over 70% of referred patients enroll in the program. In addition, the average weight of the referred patients is relatively high, i.e., a BMI over 35 kg/m².Once the patient enrolls in the program, periodic calls averaging ~15 minutes in length connect him or her to the behavior change counselors. The course consists of ten lessons that are typically completed in approximately 6 months. Average weight loss associated with this program is ~6 kg at 6 months .On an ongoing basis, counselors document patient progress into the Website in a format that allows the physician to review this information by patient or by his or her panel of referred patients. Thus, following a referral into this program, when a patient is scheduled for a follow-up clinic visit, the updated information on progress can be reviewed prior to the visit and included in the chart so that reinforcement can be provided based on current and accurate data.\n",

      "Addressing obesity in the primary care practice setting represents an important opportunity for health improvement. Despite recognition that obesity is an important health concern, efforts to provide advice, counseling, and referrals into credible programs are currently underutilized.

      "Motivating people to exercise is one of the greatest challenges in helping people adopt physical activity. The threat of cancer is life-shaking enough that most patients are willing to try anything to recover more quickly or improve their odds of survival, even if that includes beginning an exercise program. Exercise is reported as the most frequently used alternative therapy for management of diseases. I Although a diagnosis of cancer may be a trigger to increase physical activity, numerous barriers can lead to noncompliance.\n",

      "Because exercise is a voluntary activity, people often lose their motivation when faced with the challenges of lack of time, demands by family and work, and even the discomfort of exercise when a program progresses too quickly or a participant is pushed, or pushes himself or herself, beyond capacity. People begin and maintain an exercise program if the outcomes of their physical activity efforts are valued, and to many cancer patients, the outcomes of improved quality of life, and physical and emotional well-being are sufficient to persist in an exercise program.Three key concepts are related to adherence: the activity must be meaningful; the benefits need to be connected to the survivor's personal goals ; and the goals need to be realistic so that results can be seen in a step-by-step fashion.2 Outcome expectancies for each survivor need to be consistent, reasonable, and systematically set up to guide the individual toward his or her desired goals. A survivor may not have been physically active in many years or may actually be averse to physical activity. Self-confidence and belief in their ability to complete the exercise and achieve their goals successfully must be considered when developing physical activity programs for cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors who were successful in adhering to a 6-month strength and weight training program used self-efficacy to stay motivated and comply with the program.3Part of promoting an individual's confidence and self-efficacy to exercise is to help in understanding what must be done to attain desired goals. If beliefs and behaviors are consistent with the exercise program, the individual will be moving in the direction of goal attainment. Cancer patients and survivors appear to have different beliefs about the benefits of exercise and may be motivated to exercise for difference reasons.4 Exercise programs that build confidence and slowly increase the level of intensity appear to be most appealing to survivors.5Social influences can impede or enhance a patient's decision to participate in an exercise program and continue with it in the long run.6 The beliefs and attitudes of family and friends, work colleagues and health care professionals, as well as the subtle persuasion of the media, all influence a person's interest and willingness to exercise. Social influence is powerful and can have negative outcomes. Cancer survivors have reported that well-meaning family and friends discouraged them from exercise and that health care professionals did not support their decisions to exercise. 19 These negative factors affect how well a patient will adhere to physical activity. Conversely, survivors who report positive interactions with family, friends, colleagues, and health care providers are more likely to begin an exercise program and adhere to it in the long term.8An awareness of the value of physical activity for cancer survivors is growing rapidly in the lay community and numbers of exercise groups and hospital-based programs for survivors are growing. Team Survivor is a national program to promote physical activity among women with a diagnosis of cancer. This program helps women, many of whom have never been physically active, to begin to exercise. The supportive environment of exercising with other cancer survivors provides a positive social influence and reinforcement to exercise.Patients who are having a difficult time adhering to an exercise program need special attention. A discussion with the patient about conflicts and barriers can be enormously helpful in developing an appropriate exercise prescription and assisting the individual in building strategies to overcome barriers. A study testing the theory of planned behavior observed that intention to exercise among breast and prostate cancer survivors was influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.10 Another study of breast cancer survivors training for dragon boat racing also supported the theory of planned behavior, demonstrating that intention determined adherence to the program.Although most cancer survivors use exercise as a way to feel in control, feel better, look better and improve their health, the age of a patient may have some bearing on choice of exercise.11 Patients in their 20s or younger may be more motivated to improve their looks and physique, and want to feel strong and healthy again, whereas patients in their 30s, 40s, and 50s may choose to exercise so that they can maintain their ability to work, raise their family, and ward off some of the effects of aging. Patients over 60 years old often elect to exercise to maintain their physical strength and independence and slow the aging process. Older patients who are retired tend to have more time to devote to exercise, and this population is often willing and excited about joining an exercise program or adding specific exercises tailored to their daily regimen and particular needs.8 Conversely, older patients may have significant comorbidities that limit their exercise capacity.\n",

      "One's approach to the cancer patient is important.13,13 The majority of survivors report that they would prefer to meet in person to receive exercise counseling, and 77% preferred that information about exercise be provided by an exercise specialist associated with a cancer center, indicating a strong desire for trustworthy and professional information.5 Maintaining a patient's privacy and confidentiality is imperative to developing a trusting relationship in which the patient feels comfortable asking potentially sensitive questions.Information to review with patients includes their health history, exercise history, and results from fitness evaluations. Regular meetings to review individual progress can increase a survivor's motivation and interest and provide time for the individual to discuss any challenges experienced with the exercise prescription, social pressures, or personal concerns. The exercise leader who can project sensitivity, concern, and trust while imparting information about an exercise prescription developed in collaboration with the survivor will help him or her feel comfortable and informed and may even increase satisfaction and encourage greater compliance with the program.\n",

      "A challenge confronting the professional developing an exercise prescription is individualizing it to the patient.14 In the cancer setting, this concept is further complicated by the myriad side effects that patients may experience during cancer treatments and the long-term side effects that may influence mobility, strength, balance, cardiac and pulmonary function, and tactile sensations. Considering the acute and chronic side effects of therapy when organizing a group exercise program presents additional challenges. A collaborative relationship with the patient's health care team can mitigate the risks of prescribing exercise to individuals with complex medical backgrounds and possibly other comorbid conditions, which may further affect their ability to exercise.Inherent in developing an exercise prescription for patients is determining the appropriate activities. Survivors are more likely to comply with an exercise program over time if they participate in activities that they enjoy. At this point in time, it is not known whether aerobic is superior to resistance exercise, or vice versa; therefore, it is unwise to guide a patient in one direction or another. The ideal exercise program may prove to be a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise to help patients maintain and improve their cardiopulmonary function while strengthening muscles that may have been disrupted from surgery or need strengthening to improve balance and ambulation.Providing specific individualized guidelines for target heart rate ranges during aerobic exercise helps patients stay within a reasonable exercise intensity so that physical activity is fun and challenging, rather than aversive. However, when patients are receiving chemotherapy or other treatments, it is more difficult to prescribe exercise using heart rate because anemia and fluid shifts can dramatically influence heart rates. Starting patients very slowly and even breaking exercise sessions into different times of the day may be important to help them succeed without getting overly tired. Patients who keep records or logs of their exercise can see their progress, which is motivating. Logs help patients see gradual increments of improvement. They can chart the increase in duration and intensity of exercise.One of the hardest concepts for patients, whether previous exercisers or not, is that they must start slowly and build an aerobic base. As people age, it takes longer to build this base and the process of physiological adaptation needs to be given about 40% more time.15 The slow rate of progress is difficult for people who want to see instant results or who think that they should be able to exercise the way that they did when they were 20 years old. Jones' 2002 survey of cancer survivors' preferences observed that survivors prefer to exercise at a moderate intensity; this must be taken into consideration when developing exercise programs. Most survivors prefer to walk and engage in other moderate-intensity exercises.5,16Another approach to monitoring exercise intensity is using subjective measures of effort. Scales, such as Borg's Perceived Exertion Scale, can help patients to monitor their efforts. However, using subjective measures has its limits, especially among patients new to exercise. Individuals who are just beginning to exercise may find themselves focusing more on the scale and how they feel then on the exercise. Focusing on physical sensations and symptoms leads to increased perceived work intensity relative to actual workload and may result in individuals working at too low an intensity.17\n",

      "Making exercise meaningful is key to promoting a patient's commitment to and enthusiasm for exercise. It is critical to establish, with the patient, positive outcomes that are individualized, specific, realistic, and objective. When working with survivors, it is important to catch their attention andmake them aware of the significance of the changes that will occur with exercise. Work to help the individual fit exercise into his or her life and select activities that are appropriate and ideally linked to other interests.Teach survivors to counter negative beliefs and self-talk about exercise by helping them to redirect their thinking in a more positive and constructive direction. That is, instead of thinking that exercise takes too much time, think that exercise provides more energy and strength to do important activities. Pinto et al. observed that overweight and obese breast cancer survivors were more likely to have low self-efficacy than their nonoverweight peers regarding their ability to succeed with exercise.18 These patients may need individualized interventions to increase their selfefficacy and refocus their negative self-talk. Finally, educate patients about the negative consequences of not exercising - focusing on what an important role exercise has in combating the debilitating effects of inactivity and how exercise will keep them strong enough to play with their grandchildren or continue working or pursuing goals.A common precursor to noncompliance is lack of social support. Help survivors identify positive and negative sources of support and plan ways to build support from people who are positive and encouraging. Assist the individual in developing strategies to manage negative support and prevent problems before they occur. Organize exercise sessions so that family and friends can join in. Suggest that individuals use exercise time to walk the dog or spend quality time with children or friends. Help the survivor identify where he or she would prefer to exercise and with whom. Survivors have diverse and different needs and preferences, with 44% choosing to exercise alone and 40% favoring exercise programs performed at home.5Breast cancer survivors participating in dragon boat racing reported that support from their physician, spouse, and friends was key to their success, as was the belief and confidence that they could attend the program given the time constrains of daily life, fatigue, and other health problems.19 Determinants of exercise for survivors of colon cancer were also intention and perceived control.20 This study observed that colon cancer survivors' beliefs about the benefits of exercise are substantially different from those of their healthy counterparts. Survivors reported exercising to improve well-being, gain control over cancer and life, improve recovery, help cope with stress of treatment and disease, and get their mind off their disease.Establishing a step-by-step approach that leads the individual toward a regular exercise program can help those who are hesitant and unsure about starting an exercise program. This three-phase approach, called shaping,21 helps the patient build confidence; ensures that the patient paces activities to stay within the comfort zone; and avoids overexertion and getting sore or injured and provides a personalized exercise program. Behavioral contracting is another approach to motivating exercise adherence. The contract to exercise must clearly spell out the objectives, the timeframe, and any consequences of failing to uphold the agreement.22 Contracting works best when it is made between two people because then it becomes a formal commitment and there is an obligation to fulfill the agreement in the contract.\n",

      "Goal setting is an effective motivator if it is individualized, manageable, and directed toward the ultimate goals of the survivor. Well-developed goals point the survivor in a positive direction and minimize disappointment and discouragement. Short-term goals that move the individual toward the long-term goal are optimal in promoting success because the survivor can see that goals are being achieved, step by step. Although long-term adherence to exercise programs appears to be more strongly influenced by survivor's perceived success rather than actual objective success, the exercise professional's responsibility is to guide the patient in selecting reasonable, realistic, and attainable goals.Success with goal setting is connected to providing positive and constructive feedback. For feedback to be useful, it must be specific to the individual's goals, objective, and provided on a regular basis or formal schedule. Providing feedback based on objective measures is most helpful and can help survivors to identify even modest gains. Feedback on a 6- or 12-week basis is most helpful. The individual knows when to expect it and can use the information for motivation and reinforcement of the new lifestyle. Reiterate to the individual that the goals may need to be modified and revised at various times depending on progress, toleration of the exercise regimen, unanticipated changes in the treatment plan, and unexpected life events. Goal setting needs to be viewed as a fluid means to an end. For inactive survivors, providing reassurance that exercise is safe and educating them to understand the many benefits of exercise may help with exercise initiation and long-term adherence.\n",

      "It is a challenge to determine adherence rates in research on exercise in cancer patients and survivors because these studies vary in duration of the intervention, measures of adherence, and type of exercise program. Adherence rates were included in 12 studies; however, the methods of reporting the data varied. Adherence rates were reported by percentage of total subjects to percentage of attendance per subject to percentage of total training in exercise group .16,19,23-32 Although the research on adherence rate is limited, it is clear that cancer survivors exercise at a higher adherence rate than their healthy counterparts.\n",

      "Until relatively recently, exercise programs for cancer patients were not sought by patients or recommended by physicians. A growing body of research has established that, in fact, exercise may be an important component of an overall treatment plan for survivors. Promoting physical activity in the cancer setting is based on meeting the survivor's immediate and long-term goals. Developing a reasonable, realistic, and individualized program that is of a moderate intensity and not unduly physically challenging is important. It may be beneficial to help survivors identify ways to make exercise more pleasurable - whether that is to have music in the background, participate in an activity that they like, or exercise with friends and family. Although the body of research in cancer and exercise is growing, more work is needed to determine factors related to promoting exercise for survivors during and following cancer treatment.\n",

      "In a study of 5204 Nurses Health Study participants diagnosed with invasive localized breast cancer in which 860 total deaths and 681 recurrences were seen, clinical outcomes were related to body mass index at diagnosis.5 In a multivariate-adjusted analysis, weight at baseline was associated with increased risk for breast cancer recurrence and death, but these associations were seen only in participants who had never smoked. In addition, among those who had never smoked, breast cancer patients who gained weight after diagnosis had a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer death . In this report, detailed information regarding systemic therapy received was not available. This report identified a negative prognostic role for obesity in women with resected breast cancer and suggested an interaction with smoking as well. In this regard, smoking has been previously associated with breast cancer incidence6 and lung metastases from breast cancer.7,8In a report from Fox Chase Cancer Center, clinical outcome from 2010 patients diagnosed with stages I to II breast cancer were determined and related to BMI categories. At diagnosis, 22% of the patients were normal weight, 43% were overweight, and 35% were obese. The three weight groups showed no differences in terms of tumor size or lymph-node involvement, providing control for an important prognostic variable. The 5-year rates of distant metastases were 7% for patients with normal weight, 6% for overweight women, and 10% for obese individuals. Similarly, 5-year survival rates were lower in obese women compared to other groups .Enger and colleagues reported on body weight correlates with risk of breast cancer death in a population of 1376 breast cancer patients with stages I to II disease seen at one medical center.10 After 6.8 years of follow-up, 240 patients had died from breast cancer. A dose-response was seen; increasing weight also increased the likelihood of dying of breast cancer with a twofold increased risk when the lowest category of weight was compared to the highest category . In subgroup analyses, women in the upper 50th percentile of weight with estrogen receptor negative cancers were at nearly a fivefold increase mortality risk compared with women in the lower 50th percentile for weight with receptor-positive tumors. In this report influence on breast cancer recurrence was not provided.In a cohort of 512 women reported by Goodwin and Colleagues, 11 a J-shaped relationship between body weight and breast cancer prognosis was described. In this group of early stage breast cancer patients, women with low or high BMI or >25 kg/m2) had the worst outcome. These more recent reports in larger populations suggest a role of higher body weight in adversely influencing prognosis. Questions raised by the exploratory analyses performed regarding a role for smoking and receptor status, as well as lower weight extremes in this process, remain unanswered. Also, methodology differences preclude direct comparison of these reports.\n",

      "Most recently, the relationship between obesity and early stage breast cancer outcome has been addressed in analyses from randomized adjuvant breast cancer therapy trials performed by multicenter, cooperative clinical trial groups. The associations among obesity, tamoxifen use, and clinical outcomes in estrogen receptor positive early stage breast cancer have been examined in a cohort of 3385 women in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project BP-14 - a randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to placebo. With long-term follow-up exceeding 166 months, breast cancer recurrence, contralateral breast cancers, and overall survival were compared in women who were obese at diagnosis compared to normal weight women at diagnosis .12The presence or absence of obesity had no effect on tamoxifen efficacy because reduced recurrence risk and increased survival were seen with tamoxifen regardless of BMI. In this population of receptor-positive patients, breast cancer recurrence was not influenced by obesity . However, contralateral breast cancer risk and all-cause mortality were significantly greater in women diagnosed when they were obese . Thus, although obesity had no effect on recurrence risk in this population, overall mortality was significantly greater for obese breast cancer patients compared with those with normal weight.Quite similar results have been reported from an analysis conducted by the International Breast Cancer Study Group of their trials.13 This group evaluated outcome of 6792 pre- and postmenopausal patients randomized to International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials and related outcome to BMI, which was categorized as normal , intermediate , or obese . In these analyses, eight other conventional prognostic factors incorporating tumor stage and characteristics were also considered. In studies involving chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, patients with normal BMI had significantly longer overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with intermediate or obese BMI. However, when adjusted for other prognostic factors, higher BMI was associated with decreased overall survival , but not decreased disease-free survival .These two retrospective analyses of outcome in randomized cooperative group clinical trials have considerable strengths - namely, carefully defined information on tumor stage, systemic therapy delivered, and cancer outcomes. However, it is not clear how protocol eligibility requirements may have excluded individuals with extremes of weight indirectly through comorbidity exclusions. In any event, taken together , these data suggest that body weight represents an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patient survival. These cooperative reports do not exclude a potential influence of obesity or related factors on breast cancer recurrence outcome, given the limitation of their retrospective design and protocol entry requirements.\n",

      "Delay in breast cancer recurrence is important; however, improved survival and quality of life are among the major objectives of therapies provided for early stage breast cancer patients. The observed statistically significant adverse influence of obesity on overall survival and non-breast cancerrelated survival in these clinical trials - initiated decades ago in some cases - will be of increasing importance in determining outcome of currently diagnosed breast cancer patients.14 Currently, the more widespread use of mammography is diagnosing patients at an earlier stage and therapeutic improvements related to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are substantially reducing a woman's risk of death related to breast cancer recurrence. Therefore, appropriate management of obesity in breast cancer patients will become a major factor in determining clinical outcome of women with resected early stage breast cancer. 15,16\n",

Correlates of obesity with potential factors that could influence breast cancer growth are outlined in Table 34.2. Among these factors, fasting insulin has received the most attention with respect to prognostic significance. Goodwin and colleagues11 reported that, in a cohort of 512 women without known diabetes, clinical outcome was related to fasting insulin levels.

Although insulin was significantly correlated with BMI, insulin remained an independent predictor for adverse clinical outcome.11 Estrogen levels were not correlated with recurrence risk or mortality risk in these pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients.Recently, Borugian and colleagues have reported similar findings from a British Columbia Tumor Registry cohort of 603 early stage breast cancer patients in which 112 deaths have occurred.17 Using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Model, they reported a statistically significant correlation with high insulin tertile and increased mortality risk in postmenopausal breast cancer patients . In this regard, the previously mentioned report by Enger and colleagues, which found that obesity was most strongly related to mortality in women with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancers, suggests that factors other than estrogen may mediate the effect.10 In addition, cross-sectional analyses in postmenopausal women without cancer suggest that low physical activity and high caloric intake are related to higher fasting insulin levels, suggesting a role for insulin in obesity-mediated change in breast cancer outcome.18 Although obesity has been linked to higher estrogen levels as potential mediator of its adverse influence on breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women, 9 a role for obesity-induced estrogen increase has not been linked to breast cancer recurrence risk.Women who are obese are more likely to have higher caloric and dietary fat intakes and be less physically active compared to leaner women. These factors of increased energy intake, increased dietary fat intake, and reduced physical activity have been correlated with risk of at least breast cancer incidence in some reports.20-22 More recently, several of these lifestyle factors have been related to recurrence risk as well. In a cohort of a 122,000 women for the Nurses' Health Study with 2100 breast cancers and 209 deaths from cancer, the risk of breast cancer death was significantly less in women with more physical activity.28 Walking 1 hour at 3 miles per hour expends 3 MET-hours. Women with 3 to 9 MET-hours per week of physical activity had a relative risk for breast cancer death of 0.80% compared to those with >9 to 14 MET-hours/week, who had a risk of breast cancer death of 0.50%.\n",

      "Consideration of breast cancer outcomes in African American women has raised issues regarding the potential role of obesity - particularly in this population. Although age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer is lower in African American compared that of white women, African American women have higher breast cancer mortality,20 a phenomenon that has been largely unexplained.25,26Following collection of breast cancer risk factors, women were prospectively followed for breast cancer incidence, breast cancer characteristics, and breast cancer mortality. Adjustment for multiple breast cancer risk factors accounted for differences in breast cancer incidence in all minorities except for African Americans, in whom the HR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.92 continued to indicate a lower breast cancer incidence risk. African American women were nearly twice as likely to be obese and breast cancers in African Americans had unfavorable characteristics; 32% of those in African Americans but only 10% in white women were high-grade and estrogen receptor-negative .To examine the relative contribution of ethnicity/race and obesity to these results, multinomial logistic regression models of the influence on breast cancer histology of age, BMI, menopausal hormone therapy use, socioeconomic factors, and ethnicity/race were performed. In these models, BMI was only a modest nonstatistically significant predictor of the unfavorable highgrade, ER-negative cancers; ethnicity/race was highly correlated with this histology. In addition, after adjustment for prognostic factors, a higher mortality after breast cancer diagnosis was identified in African American compared to white women . Thus, comprehensive analyses suggest that factors other than obesity may contribute to the adverse outcome of African American women with breast cancer. Such findings suggest that detailed biologically based subgroup analyses may be needed to dissect relationships between obesity and breast cancer outcome correctly.\n",

      "Obesity2 and associated factors of increased dietary fat intake2233 and decreased physical activity28 have been related to adverse clinical outcome, at least in some reports, for women with breast cancer.Given the already identified factors that vary together with obesity,29 it is unlikely that retrospective analyses of existing patient populations will provide definitive information regarding a role for weight loss or weight maintenance as a breast cancer management strategy. Currently, no ongoing full-scale trials of weight loss or weight management in women with diagnosed breast cancer are being conducted. Because randomized trials and other patient populations have identified a strategy to achieve and maintain moderate weight loss that incorporates dietary counseling, increased physical activity, behavioral therapy, and ongoing medical suppression, 9 weight loss programs incorporating these elements could be recommended for evaluation in obese breast cancer patients. The status of lifestyle intervention strategies currently under evaluation in clinical trials involving breast cancer patients is outlined next.Although full-scale outcome studies of weight loss in women with breast cancer have not been conducted, several small randomized trials support the feasibility of weight loss intervention in this population.31-34 With respect to exercise, moderately sized randomized trials suggest that increased physical activity can be achieved with favorable influence - at least on physical functioning parameters including fatigue symptoms. 35,36Dietary fat intake has received the most concerted attention. Two full-scale outcome studies have been funded by the National Cancer Institute and accruals to these efforts have been completed. The Women's Intervention Nutrition Study has randomized 2437 breast cancer patients ≥ 48 years of age receiving standard breast cancer management to a control condition or a program consisting of dietary fat intake reduction. The feasibility of this intervention as been established77,38 and results suggest that the dietary fat intake reduction may improve relapse free survival of post menopausal breast cancer patients, particularly in patients who were ER receptor negative .39The Women's Healthy Eating Lifestyle study has randomized over 3000 pre- and postmenopausal women with early stage resected breast cancer to a control condition vs. a program of dietary fat intake reduction plus fruits and vegetable increase. 40,41 The feasibility of this intervention has also been reported; however, substantial weight loss has not been seen.42 Clinical outcome results of this ongoing study are anticipated in the near future.\n",

Women should attempt, at least, to maintain weight after breast cancer diagnosis. Weight gain after diagnosis is a common occurrence45 and clinicians should recommend that patients avoid or reverse this type of weight gain.

      "The USDA/HHS Dietary Guidelines for Americans 68 suggest that healthy adults engage in regular physical activity to promote well-being and healthy body weight. To reduce the risk of chronic disease in adulthood, these guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week. To help prevent unhealthy weight gain in adulthood, it is suggested to engage in approximately 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorousintensity activity on most days of the week without exceeding caloric intake. To sustain weight loss in adulthood, one should participate in at least 60 to 90 minutes of daily moderate-intensity activity without exceeding caloric intake. Activities recommended include cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility exercises, and resistance training.Although few randomized clinical trials have been conducted, most studies suggest that exercise improves quality of life in patients with breast cancer during as well as after treatment. As mentioned, increased physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of primary breast cancer and new evidence suggests a reduction in recurrence risk in women with breast cancer.44 The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals adopt an active lifestyle and engage in physical activity at least 5 or more days per week possibly to reduce risk of primary breast cancer.440 This same principle may apply to women with diagnosed breast cancer, given the new evidence. Aerobic training may help with reducing or maintaining weight after diagnosis. 31,55,56\n",

      "Weight problems are common among breast cancer patients in the U.K. An estimated 64% of patients commencing endocrine therapy and 51% commencing adjuvant chemotherapy are overweight or obese. One third of patients experience sigmificant weight gain over the course of adjuvant chemotherapy, and those receiving endocrine therapy also appear to experience gains in fat, particularly central fat. Weight gain is a major concern to patients. They often seek further information, advice, and support in their endeavors to control their weight. The ideal way of delivering weight management advice in this group is not resolved. It is likely that, for some patients, successful weight management would require a multidisciplinary team, including a dietitian and a specialist breast care nurse, with further psychological support available wherever appropriate. Low staffing levels within U.K. cancer centers mean that these services are not widely available. The use of slimming on referral, exercise on prescription, and pharmacotherapy in nonspecialist weight management services has increased.

Much of this increased risk is thought to be linked to later detection and increased nodal involvement among heavier women. Based on 6792 women, the largest analysis to date found BMI to be an independent, albeit weak, prognostic factor predicting disease free and overall survival irrespective of tumor characteristics in the overall group . The adverse effects of excess weight in this study, however, were mainly seen among pre- and perimenopausal women treated with chemotherapy without endocrine therapy. Relative risk of relapse in this group was 1.23 1.08 to 1.39) for obese women and 1.07 for overweight women compared to normal weight women. Likewise RR of overall mortality over 10 years in this group was 1.24 for obesity and 1.10 for overweight compared to normal weight women .Similarly a recent analysis among 3144 patients from the French Adjuvant Study Group trial, found BMI to be an independent prognostic factor for relapse in patients receiving chemotherapy only or combined with tamoxifen . Newman et al. found higher BMI to have a negative impact on survival among women who were estrogen receptor-positive and negative, suggesting weight may have an impact on survival via nonestrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms .The effects of excess weight among postmenopausal women receiving endocrine therapy are not resolved. In the French Adjuvant Study Group analysis BMI did not have an impact on prognosis among women receiving tamoxifen alone . In contrast, although the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project did not associate excess weight at diagnosis with increased rate of breast cancer recurrence among women receiving tamoxifen, risk of contralateral breast cancer was greater in obese and in overweight compared to normal weight women.

It is possible that changes may specifically relate to the effects of the associated lower estrogen levels or the estrogen agonist/antagonist action on body composition.

Gains in body fat and waist circumference will be perceived by women and may explain the large numbers of women who complain of \"weight gain\" during adjuvant endocrine therapy when seemingly only modest changes in body mass occur. The concern of weight gain among women may decrease compliance with these adjuvant agents.\n",

      "Lymphedema is an undesirable complication following axillary clearance or radiotherapy to the axilla that has negative physical and psychological impacts on women . Obesity has been cited as an additional risk factor for the development of lymphedema , possibly due to increased risk of postoperative infections, coupled with the increased likelihood of technical problems during axillary surgery among heavier women. Higher failure rates of the less invasive sentinel node biopsy among heavier women mean heavier women are more likely to undergo complete axillary dissection for staging.Little work has been done on the effects of weight loss on existing lymphedema. A recent randomized, controlled study undertaken at The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, examined the effects of a weight reduction diet compared to no dietary intervention in overweight women with lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer. The dietary intervention was delivered by a state-registered dietician. Women wore compression hosiery as part of their usual lymphedema management. Arm volume, as measured by circumference measurements, was significantly reduced in the weight reduction group when compared with the control group. Further research is planned by this group to examine the mechanism whereby weight reduction helps to reduce arm volume .\n",

Recent data from the Nurse's Health Study, however, suggest that moderate activity in excess of 3 hours per week may promote survival among women with stages I through III breast cancer . Exercise has been consistently shown to have beneficial effects on body composition , physical function , well-being, and fatigue in cancer patients .A recent postal survey of oncology nurses in U.K. hospitals was conducted to ascertain the extent to which exercise has a role in cancer care . This survey was not specifically examining the provision for breast cancer patients; nevertheless, it showed that, in general, use of exercise within cancer care in the U.K. is currently rare. The sample of 221 hospitals had a 62% response rate. Some kind of exercise program or class for patients was offered by 19 hospitals . In a further 17 , other opportunities for exercise were available . Among nurses, 65% were in favor of the idea of providing a specific exercise rehabilitation service for patients. Scarce resources and lack of awareness and expertise were identifiedas common barriers to establishing such a service. More than half of nurses were unaware of or unfamiliar with the published research on exercise for cancer rehabilitation and 33% reported receiving no training relating to exercise and health.

      "Patients cope better with cancer when they are provided with clear, adequate information tailored to their needs. Awareness of the importance of meeting the information needs of cancer patients is increasing within the U.K. The need for better information was a patient-identified priority in the recent national cancer patient survey .Breast cancer patients are well known to seek information regarding their disease, particularly in relation to the potential benefits of diet. Salminen et al. recently reported on the dietary information currently available and the need for dietary counseling among breast cancer patients from Australia and Finland . Approximately 30% of these women expressed the need for more information on dietary factors relating to disease. The health care professionals did not currently meet their needs for nutritional advice. Only 24% of patients had received dietary advice from health care professionals; the majority had instead received their dietary advice from the media .The limited access to dietetic advice for breast cancer patients within the U.K. most likely means that the number of patients with unmet dietary information needs is even higher. We examined changes made to diet since diagnosis of breast cancer and the sources of information that prompted these changes among 37 consecutive patients with metastatic breast cancer attending clinic in our institution. Women had a median age of 53 years and had been diagnosed a median of 3 years previously. Thirteen of the women had changed their diet since diagnosis of breast cancer, and 12 had commenced vitamin or other nutritional supplements. Only one of the women had changed her diet on the basis of advice from a health care professional. The most common sources of advice were the mass media and family and friends . Dietary changes, use of vitamin supplements, and sources of dietary information are reported in Figure 35.6A through Figure 35.6D.There is a move toward developing information leaflets in collaboration with patient support groups to increase their relevance to the patient experience. However, there is also awareness that simply providing information leaflets may not meet patients' needs. A recent focus group of cancer patients examining the information provided on cancer fatigue revealed that many patients found it difficult to access written resources. More importantly, they preferred to receive advice directly from a health care professional. Written information was no substitute for this personal advice .Women from lower social classes and women from ethnic minorities are poorly served with appropriate information. These groups are traditionally a minority of the patients diagnosed with breast cancer; however, they are increasing in number and are likely to be overweight . These patients are far more likely to depend on high-quality information from within the cancer service because they are less able to access information from external sources such as charities or the Internet. A recent survey showed that information needs of British Asian cancer patients werepoorly served. Patients in this survey expressed a need for verbal and written information conveyed in their own language. This information should be provided within the oncology service or via their general practitioner .\n",

      "The amount of fat and lean tissue should ideally be assessed in breast cancer patients. Weight is a poor predictor of changes in body fat, particularly among patients receiving chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Bioelectrical impedance is increasingly used to assess body composition in weight management settings. Impedance is the resistance of the body to the flow of an alternating current. This technique is based on the fact that lean tissues have a high water and electrolyte content and are good conductors, whereas fat is a poor conductor. Impedance measurements are thus related to the volume of the conductor, which relates to total body water, fat-free mass, and fat mass. However, impedance does not appear to be a good predictor of changes in body fat among women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy because they may have unpredictable changes in fluid and electrolyte distribution and the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fluid. A further limitation of impedance among women receiving adjuvant or endocrine therapy is that impedance is insensitive to measure changes in central fat stores .In noncancer settings, focus has increasingly been on the importance of waist measurements rather than BMI as a marker of risk for weight-related comorbidity. Specifically, waist measurements predict aspects of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia . The avoidance of metabolic syndrome is relevant among breast cancer patients. This will reduce the likelihood of comorbidities such as heart diseases and diabetes. Aspects of the metabolic syndrome - i.e., insulin resistance and a greater waist to hip ratio - have been linked to a poorer prognosis.Waist and hip circumferences should be measured alongside weight measurements among breast cancer patients. For non-Asian women, a waist circumference > 32 in. is considered to place women at an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, and a waist circumference > 35 in. places women at high risk of metabolic syndrome. For Asian women, a waist greater than 32 in. places women at high risk of metabolic syndrome. In our studies among early breast cancer patients, the proportion of women who had a \"high-risk\" waist measurement at 1 year from commencing adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant endocrine therapy increased significantly.\n",

      "Homo sapiens survived the rigors of the African savannah and migrated to the rest of the globe because of the capacity and the need to move. We evolved as a nomadic species that lived by cunning and mobility, not by specialized skills and tools of the predator (no slicing teeth, no slashing claws) or by the herd behavior and acceleration of the herbivore. Movement, to gather and hunt through the day and to spread far and wide over longer time scales, has helped define who and what we are.  \n",
      "Even when we abandoned our gatherer-hunter lifestyle for the settled agricultural life, we moved - to plant, to weed, to reap, to protect the crops, to defend the village. The industrial laborer and the miner, like the agricultural laborer, earned their bread by the sweat of their brows. Only in the last hundred years has a significant proportion of humanity - and it is a greater proportion every day - ceased to move to earn a wage.  \n",
      "There is a price to pay: with lack of physical activity comes obesity, particularly when accompanied by a remarkable abundance of food and the insatiable desire of the food manufacturers to push ever increasing consumption. With obesity come the diseases that we used to think of as the diseases of affluence. However, these increasingly afflict the urban poor in the developed and developing world; they are better thought of as the diseases of inertia.  \n",
      "Mostly we think of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this context, but it is increasingly clear that cancer is also a disease of inertia. In this book, a broadly multidisciplinary group presents the evidence and provides the recommendations.  \n",
      "The antidote to diseases of inertia is movement - let's move!\n",

      "Many clinicians, researchers, and lay public associate an expanding waistline and a couch-potato lifestyle with increased tendency to develop cardiovascular disease and some of its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia). These lifestyle factors, however, also play into the etiology and prognosis of several types of cancers, which is important in the clinical and public health areas. It is important to public health because cancer is a common disease (one in two men and one in three women will develop cancer in their lifetime) and overweight or obesity and sedentary behavior are extremely common and becoming more so (two thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, and three quarters do not meet the minimal recommendations for 30 minutes of aerobic activity per day). It is important to medicine because a marked increase in a consistent risk factor will mean an increase in number of cancer cases unless some other widespread prevention factor negates this effect.  \n",
      "In addition, the implications for poorer prognosis in affected individuals means that treating oncologists and other health care providers will need to develop new and better therapies to deal with the declining prognosis in this large segment of the population. Clinicians should be aware that, because two thirds of the American population is overweight or obese and being overweight increases risk for cancer, the vast majority of cancers in the future will occur in overweight and obese individuals.  \n",
      "The association between obesity and a sedentary lifestyle with risk for cancer has been appreciated for several decades. Only in the past 10 years or so, however, has the strength and consistency of this association been apparent. This is largely due to two things: (1) the increase in prevalence in overweight, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles; and (2) an increase in the number of epidemiological studies focusing on these associations.  \n",
      "The American Cancer Society estimates that a third of all cancer deaths could be prevented through avoidance of obesity and sedentary lifestyles. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that 25 to 30% of several cancers could be prevented if individuals avoided lifetime weight gain and obesity and participated in regular physical activity. These same organizations and several clinical groups are now recognizing the important role that physical activity can play in improving quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. This area is new, so there is great need for a definitive textbook that provides the scientific background and evidence supporting these relationships, as well as clinical guidelines for bringing physical activity and weight control into cancer prevention and treatment practices throughout the world.  \n",
      "We are very fortunate to have a world-class roster of authors for this text. The chapter authors have been chosen because they are the top researchers in the field of obesity, physical activity, and cancer.  \n",
      "Section I focuses on the research methods used in assessing the associations between physical activity, energy balance, and cancer risk and prognosis. Observational epidemiological studies can provide important information about relationships among these variables. More definitive evidence of the effect of changing behaviors, with resulting change in level of adiposity and amount of energy expended, is provided through randomized clinical trials. Dr. Prentice, principal investigator of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Coordinating Center and a world expert on nutrition and cancer describes the benefits and drawbacks of each of these study design methods.  \n",
      "The measurement of energy balance and physical activity are far from straightforward. Energy balance involves the interplay among energy intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic rate. Genetic, age, and gender factors also play an important role. Defining what exactly energy balance is and what aspects of excessive adiposity are most pertinent to cancer and determining how much physical activity a person is actually doing are all great challenges requiring the concerted input of measurement experts. Drs. Ainsworth and Coleman present the intricacies of exercise and physical activity measurement, and Dr. Irwin describes the pluses and minuses of the many ways of assessing body composition.  \n",
      "The role of physical activity in the incidence of individual cancers is the focus of Section II. In a comprehensive literature review, Drs. Patel and Bernstein write about the intriguing data pointing to a role of exercise and physical activity in reducing risk for breast cancer. They compare and contrast the types of epidemiological studies and the role of exercise and physical activity in premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. The many studies on exercise, physical activity, and colon cancer are reviewed by Dr. Slattery, who summarizes how exercise plays a role in colon cancer etiology. She also reviews the evidence regarding the association between physical activity and rectal cancer occurrence. Dr. Friedenreich elegantly summarizes the state of knowledge on the associations between exercise and prostate cancer risk, pointing out why the associations are not yet firm and suggesting future research pathways.  \n",
      "Section III focuses on mechanisms that may explain the inverse association between physical activity and incidence of several cancers. Dr. McTiernan reviews the effect of exercise on sex hormones, which has relevance for several hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and prostate. Dr. Frank reviews the role of exercise in reducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; insulin has been shown to promote tumor cells in vitro, and persons with high insulin levels have increased risk for some cancers and reduced prognosis once diagnosed with breast cancer. Ms. Wetmore and Dr. Ulrich review the literature on the complicated associations between physical activity and several markers of immune function, especially ones that may be relevant to cancer occurrence or prognosis. Dr. Martinez describes the effect of exercise on prostaglandins, which may in part explain the consistent findings of reduced colon cancer risk among active, compared with sedentary, persons. Drs. Thompson, Jiang, and Zhu describe the animal model research that has defined the role of excess adiposity and of energy restriction on tumorogenesis. The current state of human intervention studies on physical activity and cancer biomarkers is presented by Dr. McTiernan. Dr. Rankinen reviews the intriguing new field of genetics, physical activity, and cancer, which may help to define persons who may be helped with activity in terms of cancer risk.  \n",
      "Section IV focuses on the breadth and depth of knowledge on the effect of overweight and obesity on cancer incidence. Dr. Ballard-Barbash presents the state of knowledge regarding the effects of weight, adiposity, lifetime weight change, and risk of breast cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Drs. Kaaks and Lukanova present similar information for the effect of increasing adiposity on the development of endometrial cancer. Drs. Michaud and Giovannucci present the emerging data linking increased adiposity with increased risk for pancreatic cancer. The new and increasing body of knowledge regarding the effect of obesity on esophageal cancer is presented by Drs. Hoyo and Gammon. Dr. Slattery reviews the role of overweight and obesity in the etiology of colon cancer.  \n",
      "Section V reviews the mechanisms that might explain the association between adiposity and incidence of several cancers. Drs. Kaaks and McTiernan describe the role of adipose tissue in the production and metabolism of sex hormones, which is important for several hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and prostate cancers. Dr. Blackburn presents the state of knowledge regarding obesity and insulin resistance, taking from the extensive depth of information available from diabetic research results. Drs. Priest and Church present data on the effect of adiposity on cytokines and inflammatory markers that may have particular relevance for cancer. The important role of animal studies in shedding light on the effect of exercise on biology related to cancer formation is described in depth by Dr. Colbert. Drs. Tworoger and McGrath present the emerging body of literature on the genetics of obesity as it pertains to cancer incidence.  \n",
      "Section VI concentrates on the importance of physical activity on aspects of quality of life and prognosis for many cancer patients. Dr. Winters-Stone describes the studies that have examined the effect of exercise and physical activity on fatigue in breast cancer patients and survivors. Dr. Courneya, Ms. Campbell, Ms. Karvinen, and Ms. Ladha describe studies that have explored the effect of exercise on quality of life in colon and other cancer patients. Drs. Abrahamson and Gammon describe the emerging information on the role of physical activity in cancer prognosis and suggest biological mechanisms that might explain the association.  \n",
      "Section VII presents information on the role of overweight and obesity on prognosis of several cancers. Dr. Goodwin reviews the many studies that have examined the effect of adiposity on breast cancer recurrence and survival and presents suggested mechanisms for such relationships. Dr. Rock presents results of recent studies pointing to a role of adiposity on survival and recurrence in patients with colon, prostate, and other cancers.  \n",
      "The final section, Section VIII, gives the reader clues to how the information presented in the rest of the book might be implemented at the individual, clinical, and public health levels. Dr. Fogelholm writes on the use of exercise and physical activity in weight control at the individual level. Dr. Heber and Ms. Bowerman provide information on dietary and other methods of energy balance for overweight and obese persons. Dr. Bull describes population-level initiatives to increase physical activity in population settings. Dr. Pronk provides insight into disseminating exercise and diet interventions into the primary care setting. Drs. Schwartz and Winters-Stone provide advice on initiating and maintaining increased exercise and physical activity in cancer patients and survivors. Finally, Drs. Chlebowski, Geller, Harvie and Howell provide guidance on incorporating exercise and diet recommendations into clinical oncology practice.  \n",
      "We hope that this volume provides a comprehensive review of the roles of energy balance, physical activity, and cancer incidence and prognosis. The epidemic of overweight and obesity and the increasing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles will have an impact on the magnitude and quality of the cancer problem around the globe. Viewed differently, knowing that energy balance is so important to the risk and prognosis from cancer may be an important incentive for the general public, persons at high risk, and cancer patients and survivors to increase physical activity, reduce excess weight, and maintain energy balance lifelong.\n",

      "This chapter is concerned with the strengths and weaknesses of, and the role played by, major observational and interventional study designs in cancer prevention through exercise and weight control research agenda. Because the research study design issues tend to be similar for the prevention of cancer and for other major chronic diseases, the discussion is broadened to the role of these study designs in chronic disease prevention. Also, issues related to physical activity assessment have much in common with those for dietary assessment, and energy balance is central to weight control, so the discussion also highlights issues arising in the study of diet and nutrition and chronic disease prevention.  \n",
      "A major goal of a research program aimed at weight control and chronic disease prevention is the development of evidence-based preventative recommendations for the general population and for its major subgroups, along with the development of practical approaches to satisfying such recommendations. Pharmaceutical approaches also have a role among chronic disease prevention tools for persons for whom behavioral strategies may be insufficient. In either case, preventative recommendations need to have an overriding focus on overall health benefits vs. risks, with important implications for research designs and emphases.  \n",
      "From the obesity epidemic in the United States and other Western countries, and from the strong associations between overweight and obesity and the incidence and mortality from cancer [1] and other chronic diseases, it seems evident that Western societies are suffering a tremendous disease burden owing to unfavorable physical activity and dietary consumption patterns. However, available recommendations concerning the amount and type of physical activity [2-5] and nutrient consumption and dietary patterns [5-8] have been only modestly influenced by chronic disease prevention considerations, because of limitations in available research data. Related to this, research that aims to develop and test behavioral interventions and strategies for improving physical activity and dietary patterns for individuals or communities tends to be hampered by a lack of consensus on desirable intervention goals.  \n",
      "Indeed, the development of practical physical activity and dietary recommendations that may help to reverse overweight, obesity, and chronic disease trends is a most challenging research aim, though many opportunities are currently available. The obvious epidemiological approach to gaining the requisite knowledge involves comparing persons with various physical activity and dietary patterns in respect to subsequent weight changes and chronic disease event rates. In fact, cohort studies, along with other observational designs, do constitute a mannstay approach in exercise and nutritional epidemiology. However, epidemiological research on these patterns is attended by some important issues that can cast aspersions on the reliability and interpretation of reported associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Document 61:\n",
      "The first issue concerning the reliability and interpretation of observational studies in these areas is classical epidemiological confounding. For example, persons sustaining a high level of physical activity over much of their lifespan may differ in many biobehavioral respects from more sedentary persons. These may, for example, include socioeconomic factors, skill level in sports, aspects of physical functioning and emotional status, and dietary habits. Insofar as these factors also relate to weight maintenance and chronic disease risk, they need to be recognized, accurately measured, and properly included in data analysis to avoid confounding. In fact, such comprehensive confounding control is rarely practical, so there is always some uncertainty, for example, as to whether a reported association of a physical activity pattern with a chronic disease risk is attributable in part to corresponding uncontrolled differences in diet or other potential confounding factors.  \n",
      "Very similar confounding issues attend dietary patterns, with physical activity as an important potential confounder. Additionally, studies aimed at elucidating the relationship of the consumption of specific nutrients or foods to chronic disease risk need to acknowledge potential confounding by other nutrients and food that may be highly correlated with those under investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Document 62:\n",
      "An equally important issue in physical activity and dietary epidemiology concerns \"exposure\" assessment. Physical activity is typically self-reported by means of records, logs, or recalls. The instruments used may have demonstrated some degree of repeatability in populations of interest, but the accuracy, and measurement properties more generally, are usually unknown. Alternatively, physical activity is sometimes indirectly assessed using physiological methods. For example, measures of cardiopulmonary fitness, such as maximum oxygen output volume, have been used to produce estimates of normal physical activity [9], although such measures may be insensitive to low-intensity or longer term activity levels.  \n",
      "Most observational studies, however, rely on self-reported physical activity assessments obtained using personal interviews or mailed questionnaires that ask the respondent to recall historic information; this is used to construct physical activity estimates over time. Clearly, such physical activity estimates may include substantial measurement error. Statistical approaches to accommodating such measurement error [10] almost universally assume a classical measurement model in which the assessment, Z, relates to the targeted actual physical activity, X (e.g., average METs/day over the past decade), via  \n",
      "$Z=X+e$  \n",
      "where the measurement error term e is assumed to be statistically independent of X and independent of other study subject characteristics and confounding factors.  \n",
      "Unfortunately, these methods will generally not yield accurate estimates of association between physical activity and disease risk if a more complex measurement model is required. For example, if overweight or obese persons tend to perceive and report physical activity differently than do normal or underweight persons, biased associations can be expected. Similarly, if physical activity reporting depends on age, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, social desirability factors, or dietary patterns, bias can be expected to the extent that these factors are related to the outcomes under study.  \n",
      "Note that this issue of systematic bias in physical activity assessment is quite distinct from the confounding issue cited previously. For example, suppose that, in a cohort study of physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk, overweight women tend to report greater physical activity than leaner women, although their actual physical activity tends to be somewhat less. Such systematic bias in assessment will distort and may even reverse the direction of the estimated physical activity and disease risk association. The inclusion of an indicator variable for overweight in a regression analysis of breast cancer risk, which may be considered to prevent confounding, cannot be expected to resolve the distortion caused by systematic bias in physical activity assessment.  \n",
      "The use of objective measures of physical activity, at least in a subset of the study cohort, provides potential to avoid major biases due to measurement error. An objective measure is one in which the measurement error is independent of study subject characteristics or other confounding factors. For example, the maximum oxygen output volume previously mentioned may plausibly satisfy this criterion. Additionally, the objective measure should adhere to the classical measurement model (Equation 1.1) so that the assessment measures the targeted quantity, X, aside from random error. This may be a difficult criterion to satisfy because potential objective measures of physical activity may often be insensitive, incomplete, or variable over time in their response to specific physical activity patterns.  \n",
      "The doubly labeled water measure of energy expenditure [11] provides a valuable tool for objectively measuring physical activity. The rates of recovery of two nonradioactive isotopes in urine, following bolus consumption in the form of doubly labeled water, allows carbon dioxide production, and thus energy expenditure, to be estimated accurately over a short-term (typically 2 weeks) period. Subtraction of basal metabolic energy expenditure, as determined by indirect calorimetry, yields an assessment of physical activity-related energy expenditure that plausibly adheres to Equation 1.1 as an estimate of actual (short-term) energy expenditure. The costs of this approach (specifically of the doubly labeled water) are such that it is not a practical approach for all members of a study cohort, which typically includes tens of thousands of study subjects if rare diseases are under study. Rather, such a procedure can only be applied to a modest subset of cohort members. The relationship between the objective measure and self-report measures can then be used to calibrate the self-report measures on the remainder of the cohort, and the calibrated values play a fundamental role in analyses to associate physical activity-related energy expenditure to disease risk.  \n",
      "To date, the doubly labeled water method has evidently not been used in large epidemiological cohort studies of physical activity, at least not on the scale required for the calibration procedure just mentioned. The doubly labeled water measure has received greater use, however, in nutritional epidemiology, in which the estimate of energy expenditure can reasonably be equated to short-term energy consumption among weight-stable persons. For example, the National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition (OPEN) Study [12,13] used the doubly labeled water method, along with urinary nitrogen [14], as an objective recovery measure [15] of protein consumption among 484 men and women aged 40 to 69; this project studied the structure of measurement error in commonly used dietary self-report instruments, including a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall.  \n",
      "A Nutrient Biomarker Study among 544 women is currently nearing completion within the dietary modification component of the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial among nearly 48,835 postmenopausal women [16]. In that context, energy consumption, X, will be related to disease risk using the measurement model, Equation 1.1, for the doubly labeled water measure, Z, along with the measurement model [17]:  \n",
      "$$W=a+bX+cV+dX\\otimes V+r+u\\tag{1.2}$$  \n",
      "for the food frequency energy consumption estimate W, where V represents factors such as obesity, age, or ethnicity that may affect how a person reports dietary consumption, the term X®V allows the influence of these factors on reporting to depend on actual consumption X, r represents a personspecific bias (random effect) term, u represents random error, and all variates on the right side of Equation 1.1 and Equation 1.2 are assumed to be statistically independent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Document 63:\n",
      "In addition to the avoidance of confounding, and the need for a suitable measurement error model, observational studies of physical activity and diet in relation to chronic disease risk require the selection of representative study subjects from the target population and outcome ascertainment that is unrelated to study exposures. It is reasonable to ask how related potential sources of bias should affect one's evaluation and interpretation of the reliability of observational study reports describing associations, or lack thereof, between some aspect of exercise and diet and the risk of a chronic disease. In fact, the many ways to present measures of these exposures and to slice exposure ranges tend to reduce study reliability unless the authors have adhered to a prespecified analysis plan.  \n",
      "The overall question of study reliability is, however, often difficult to answer. The discussion section of observational study reports often runs down a list of potential biases, and the authors give their opinions as to why each bias is not expected to be of importance. Indeed, decades of intensive risk factor studies using cohort or case-control designs for a number of chronic diseases, along with the development of corresponding analytic procedures, have put the epidemiologist in a position to make a serious effort to control confounding. The extent to which the inclusion of standard disease risk factors, as determined by questionnaire, in logistic regression or Cox regression analyses guards against confounding by poorly measured potential confounding factors is unclear. Such factors include those related to physical activity or diet, or biobehavioral factors. However, typical observational study confounding factors should go some distance in reducing the source of bias.  \n",
      "Exposure measurement error, on the other hand, is much less explored in terms of plausible magnitude of impact on observational study results in the exercise and diet arena. There has been some study of energy consumption reporting as a function of body weight. In one sizeable study, energy consumption on food diaries tended to be substantially less than corresponding doubly labeled water estimates among obese persons, with little difference among normal weight persons [18]. Studies of breast cancer occurrence in the U.K. find rather different relationships to dietary fat intake, depending on the type of dietary assessment instrument applied [19]. The OPEN study [13] reported positive assessment error correlations for energy and protein between a food frequency instrument and 24-hour dietary recalls. This finding reduces the plausibility that a self-report assessment can serve as a \"reference instrument\" that adheres to Equation 1.1 for the purpose of calibrating a food frequency assessment in a cohort study analysis. These studies are not definitive, but they do raise the measurement error issue as one that needs to be resolved if nutrition and physical activity observational studies are to have a clear and direct interpretation.\n",

Indeed, disease rate comparisons will not be confounded by prerandomization factors, whether or not they can be measured well or even recognized. Furthermore, such comparisons do not depend on physical activity or dietary assessment for their validity although such assessments for the randomized groups as a whole are needed for trial interpretation. In addition, an intervention trial setting can provide an excellent context for outcome ascertainment that is common across intervention groups.  \n",
      "These types of considerations have caused the randomized, controlled trial to be the central study design in most therapeutic research settings. However, disease prevention research has some critical practical limitations. Specifically, because the outcomes targeted for prevention have low incidence rates over a trial follow-up period of a few years' duration, preventative trials typically need to be very large scale, perhaps in the tens of thousands. Difficult logistics and great expense typically attend such large trials, so a handful at most can be supported at a given point in time. Furthermore, the physical activity or dietary changes to be tested may be difficult to maintain over the several years that may be required to affect chronic disease risk by a detectable amount. Also, a range of other behavioral changes may accompany the changes targeted by the interventions under study, thus reducing the etiologic, but perhaps not the public health, implications of trial results.  \n",
      "For the reasons just outlined, proposals to conduct full-scale intervention trials for chronic disease prevention are often met with skepticism and resistance. Critics may examine trial cost estimates and consider the number of individual research grants that could be supported by the requisite amount of funding. Others may question whether the underlying hypothesis or the intervention to achieve study goals has been developed with sufficient care and thoroughness. These are important issues that proponents of a prevention trial must adequately address before a randomized controlled trial can proceed.\n",

      "One response to the cost and logistics issue associated with a full-scale intervention trial having disease outcomes is the use of short-term responses, which may be altered as a part of a carcinogenesis or other disease pathway, as an intervention trial outcome variable. For example, a recent exercise intervention trial [20] was conducted in 173 sedentary, overweight postmenopausal women randomly assigned to a moderate-intensity exercise program or to a control (self-selected physical activity) group; outcomes included serum hormone concentrations and body fat distribution [21,22]. This type of physical activity trial, as well as small-scale human nutrition intervention trials, has an important place in the chronic disease prevention research agenda.  \n",
      "With a varied set of meaningful intermediate outcomes, such trials can provide much insight into the disease prevention potential of an intervention and a context for developing intervention procedures that can achieve physical activity and dietary goals and maintain them over the typical trial follow-up period of a few months. Intermediate outcome trials, however, are generally not a  \n",
      "sufficient replacement for a full-scale trial; in a number of contexts, favorable intermediate outcome changes have been shown not to convey meaningful disease prevention benefits, and interventions may have unsuspected consequences for outcomes other than those targeted for prevention. Thus, appropriate forums are needed to identify the most promising and timely physical activity and nutrition interventions for full-scale testing.\n",

      "Sources of intervention hypotheses in the exercise and nutrition area include observational studies and therapeutic trials. Both sources are valuable. As explained earlier, observational studies may lack specificity due to highly correlated patterns of the consumption of various nutrients and may lack reliability more generally. Furthermore, observational studies may not be well configured to examine the health effects of changes in physical activity or dietary patterns and usually are not concerned with methods and procedures to achieve exercise or dietary goals. On the other hand, therapeutic trials cannot be expected to yield interventions that act predominantly at the early stages of disease development and may infrequently focus on behavioral interventions.  \n",
      "For example, preclinical trials of physical activity and diet in rodent systems can provide valuable insights into interventions that may have favorable effects on cancer processes (e.g., carcinogen metabolism, hormone regulation, cell division and differentiation, apoptosis, and cellcycle regulation) and on processes relevant to other chronic diseases. An interesting special case is provided by studies of dietary restriction in rodents in relation to disease risk and longevity [23.24]. These types of trials, which typically involve a moderate number of animals and a few months' duration, can inform the small-scale human intervention trials mentioned previously.  \n",
      "In both settings, the ongoing development of high-dimensional genotyping, gene and protein expression, and metabolomic approaches provides the opportunity for specific and comprehensive hypothesis development activities. Hypothesis development initiatives need to target a medical model that tailors interventions to a person's genotype as well as specific exposures and characteristics and, equally importantly, a public health model that aims to develop physical activity and nutrition recommendations and interventions applicable to major segments of the general population.\n",

      "In a number of chronic disease prevention settings, one has extensive observational data along with one or more randomized controlled trials, and the results (at least superficially) disagree between the two sources. These provide a particular opportunity to assess study design and analysis properties and to identify approaches to strengthening each type of study. For example, in the nutrition area, observational studies of beta-carotene consumption in relation to the incidence of lung and other cancers suggested important preventative potential [25,26]; however, subsequent controlled trials found no effect [27] or an apparently adverse effect [28,29] of beta-carotene supplementation. It remains unclear whether the observational studies were too nonspecific to allow favorable lung cancer trends to be attributed to this specific nutrient or were otherwise misleading, or whether consumption at low levels in food is beneficial but higher level supplementation is harmful. Similarly, observational studies indicating lower colorectal cancer incidence among persons consuming low-fat, high-fiber diets were not supported by subsequent trials of colorectal adenoma recurrence prevention using wheat bran fiber [30] or a low-fat eating pattern [31]. These trials again raise questions about the specificity and reliability of the observational studies, as well as about the utility and necessary follow-up duration in adenoma recurrence trials.  \n",
      "A striking example of an apparent observational vs. trial discrepancy arises in studies of combined postmenopausal hormone therapy and coronary heart disease, in which observational studies [32] suggest a 40 to 50% reduction in incidence; however, a recent randomized controlled trial [33] found an incidence rate elevation over a 5.6-year intervention period. Although studies are still under way [34] to explain such discrepancy, an important aspect seems to be a hazard ratio function that is elevated early, but subsequently declines and may reverse direction. Available trial data were highly influenced by the early elevation, although such available observational data depend predominantly on follow-up that begins some years after hormone therapy initiation.  \n",
      "The identification of study design and analysis procedures that can avoid these types of discrepancies is an important research goal in the physical activity, diet, and chronic disease prevention research area. The manner and extent to which discrepancies can be resolved and avoided also will help identify the complementary role to be played by observational studies and full-scale intervention trials.\n",

      "The potential of exercise and dieting changes to improve health and prevent chronic disease risk is such that it merits attention and best efforts of the public health-oriented research community. Additional basic and clinical science efforts are needed to identify interventions for testing in human populations. Also, too few research groups are configured to carry out the small-scale exercise or nutrition intervention trials, with a comprehensive set of outcomes, out of which a specific intervention for full-scale testing may arise. Although observational study of exercise and dietary factors with disease risk is substantial, studies that use biomarkers in a fundamental way in association tests are particularly needed.\n",

      "Despite the available research and the known benefits of physical activity, 45% of U.S. adults do not accumulate a sufficient amount of physical activity to derive health benefits and 16% do not engage in any physical activity during their leisure time [1]. Because many health experts attribute the obesity epidemic [2] and elevated risks for some chronic diseases to physical inactivity [3], a priority has been placed on the use of valid and reliable measures to assess all levels of physical activity [3,4]. This is especially true for understudied populations such as ethnic minorities and women [5].  \n",
      "Numerous reviews of physical activity assessment have been conducted in the past decade, including several for self-report [6-8], objective activity monitoring [9,10], and cancer studies [11,12]. In 1999, the Cooper Aerobics Institute held a conference specifically for the measurement of physical activity, the proceedings of which were published in a special supplement of Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport [13]. In addition, a reference text for the assessment of physical activity was also recently published [9].  \n",
      "This chapter is limited to the methods used to assess physical activity using direct and indirect measures. For the purposes of this review, direct measures are considered \"real time\" in that they assess physical activity concurrently with the activity. Direct measures include physical activity records, observation, and activity monitors. Indirect methods assess physical activity retrospectively and include self-report questionnaires, structured recall interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic life-history methods. Using direct and indirect methods to assess physical activity is growing in popularity [9,14] and is recommended by most physical activity researchers as a more comprehensive way of indexing a person's physical activity.\n",

      "LaMonte and Ainsworth [15] present a conceptual framework for the measurement of movement as a global construct. The construct has two dimensions: physical activity (a behavior) and energy expenditure (the energy cost of the behavior). Both dimensions can be measured using the direct and indirect methods depicted in Figure 2.1. This review is limited to the measurement of physical activity and not energy expenditure. However, the measurement of energy expenditure is often used to infer physical activity, especially when measures like doubly labeled water and activity monitors are used. This partly reflects the controversy in public health about whether a minimal level of energy expenditure or bodily movement leads to the protective benefits of physical activity [3,4].  \n",
      "Activity monitors often provide estimates of energy expenditure and bodily movement; when they are validated, they are compared to actual energy expenditure, not body movement (an exception is with pedometers that have actual number of steps counted by observers) [9]. Selfreport is much more complex because no objective assessment of bodily movement is made. Instead, the type, duration, frequency, and intensity are assessed; this may be used to estimate energy expenditure and then related to health outcomes [15].\n",

      "The four basic types of activity monitors: (1) measure acceleration (accelerometers); (2) measure the movement of the body up and down when a person lifts the feet off the ground (pedometers); (3) monitor heart rate; and (4) measure changes in body temperature. An accelerometer detects acceleration and deceleration in one or more planes of motion (vertical, longitudinal, and medial). A uniaxial accelerometer measures acceleration in the vertical plane, and biaxial and triaxial accelerometers are sensitive to movements in two and three dimensions, respectively. When these devices detect movement, an electric current proportional to the degree of acceleration is generated  \n",

      "within the motion sensor. Because acceleration increases in several dimensions with faster movements, theoretically, accelerometers should accurately determine energy expenditure across a wide range of exercise intensities [16].  \n",
      "There are a myriad of activity monitors available for research [9]. Triaxial accelerometers include the TriTrac R3D (Professional Products Inc., Madison, WI), the RT3 Tri-axial Research Tracker (Stayhealthy Inc., Monrovia, CA), and the Tracmor (available from Klaus Westerterp, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The RT3 Tri-axial Research Tracker is the third generation of the TriTrac models. The two most common uniaxial accelerometers are the Caltrac (Muscle Dynamics, Torrence, CA) and the Computer Science Applications (CSA) monitor (Shalimar, FL), now known as the MTI Actigraph (Fort Walton Beach, FL). The new generation models are not the same as the old models and thus validity and reliability should be assessed separately for these new devices [17]. The BioTrainer-Pro (IM Systems, Baltimore, MD) is the only stand-alone biaxial accelerometer currently available for research.  \n",
      "At least 13 different pedometers are available for research [18]; however, to date, the Yamax models (New Lifestyles, Inc., Lee's Summit, MO) are the most accurate. Although many heart rate monitors are commercially available, almost all studies have been done using Polar models (Polar Electro Inc., New York) because of their ability to store large amounts of information [19]. Finally, the SenseWear Armband (BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) is a new device that contains a biaxial accelerometer, a heart rate receiver, and a thermocoupler with the unique capability of measuring heat production.  \n",
      "Which monitor is \"best\" depends a great deal on the target population, the monetary resources of the project, the time and labor available to the project, and the research questions. No activity monitor provides the type of activity engaged in, and thus some kind of self-report must always accompany the monitor if this is an important research question. The accelerometers can store up to 30 days of minute-to-minute activity; however, they cost approximately $500 per monitor and hours of labor and computer programming are necessary to consolidate data into meaningful intensity, frequency, and duration information. The BioTrainer Pro has demonstrated the poorest validity for the measurement of energy expenditure (and thus physical activity) of all the available accelerometers [17,20]; the CSA (now referred to as the MTI Actigraph) with the Freedson correction for energy expenditure [21] and the TriTrac R3D [17,22] have the best validity.  \n",
      "Pedometers provide the most user friendly and economical approach ($10 to $20 each) to activity monitoring. In addition, they are often excellent sources of immediate feedback for participants [10]. However, they cannot \"store\" daily activity data, so participants must record their steps each day, and they have limited validity in assessing any activities that are not related to walking [23]. Finally, although expensive ($500 each), the SenseWear Armband may have some promise as a research tool. It seems to be a valid indicator of energy expenditure at a variety of walking speeds [17,24] and its position on the upper arm avoids the extraneous movement common to accelerometers worn around the waist [25].\n",

      "One of the most accurate, comprehensive direct measures of physical activity is systematic observation [9,26]. Information can be collected about the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of any observable physical activity [9,26]. This field has been almost exclusively devoted to the observation of school-aged children's physical activity [27-29]. The two main systems used in research are the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT), its newest variant, the System for Observing Play and Physical Activity in Youth (SOPLAY) [30,31], and the Children's Activity Rating Scale (CARS) [32]. These tools have been extensively validated in a variety of settings including the classroom [33], physical education [34], and after school [35].  \n",

      "Physical activity records provide a detailed account of activities done within a given period of time [8]. Records are useful in identifying the type, duration, and frequency of activities and may take the form of a written diary or record book, dictation into a tape recorder, or by recalling the prior days' activities in the presence of a trained interviewer. Physical activity records have been used to describe activity patterns in populations [38–41] and to validate physical activity questionnaires [42]. Irwin and colleagues [43] provide detailed instructions in the use of a physical activity record.  \n",
      "The precision of physical activity records has been studied using doubly labeled water. Irwin et al. [43] compared recorded physical activity in the form of estimated energy expenditure with doubly labeled water kilocalories obtained during a 7-day period, showing difference in kilocalorie estimates on the order of 7.9 ± 3.2% kcal. Unfortunately, physical activity records have many drawbacks, mostly concerning the large participant burden and limited application to people with low-literacy skills. Recording physical activity can interfere with daily activities, resulting in poor compliance to study protocols. In addition, physical activity records share with qualitative data the expense of time in coding descriptive information into quantitative data. However, with the refinement of hand-held tape recorders, palm pilots with voice- and handwriting-recognition software to facilitate recording and coding of physical activity records, the drawbacks related to participant burden and data management may be minimized [44]. Advancements in voice-recognition software will eliminate the need for writing altogether, increasing the use of physical activity records in lowliteracy populations [451.\n",

      "Physical activity logs are checklists used to record the type and duration of activities performed during intermittent periods of the day or at the end of a single day. A good example is the Bouchard Physical Activity Log [39], which has users check the type and intensity of activity that they complete every 15 minutes during a specific period of the day. Another example is the Ainsworth Physical Activity Log that has users review a list of activities at the end of each day and estimate the total duration in hours and/or minutes during which they performed each activity [8]. Physical activity logs can be tailored for specific research or practice settings to reflect the purposes of a study or to highlight specific activities performed. For example, a walking log may focus only on walking activities performed in specific settings, such as occupation, transportation, household, and leisure settings [46]. These logs may also be tailored to monitor physical activity during clinical trials to track the types and amounts of activity performed in supervised and freeliving settings.  \n",
      "Physical activity logs have advantages over detailed records in that they substantially reduce the burden of recording for the participants. However, the trade-off comes with the limitation that physical activity logs provide less detailed information about specific activities performed and are subject to recall bias; thus, they may not be as accurate as direct detailed records.\n",

      "Global questionnaires are short instruments that provide a general classification of one's physical activity status as active or inactive. The questionnaires are usually very short and often reflect participation in structured exercise. They provide few details about specific patterns and types of physical activity performed. Several validated questionnaires are available in the public domain with 1-month test-retest reliabilities from r = 0.80 to 0.90 [47]. Validity is on the order of r = 0.30 when compared with cardiorespiratory fitness, activity monitors, and physical activity records [42]. Because global questionnaires are short and easy to construct, many researchers develop global questions designed to meet specific study needs. These questionnaires may or may not be validated and, if not validated, their accuracy in classifying people by physical activity levels is unknown.\n",

      "Self-administered recall questionnaires assess the frequency and duration of specific activities for 1 to 2 weeks in the past. The questionnaires may be completed in person, by postal mail, or by email. Examples of two commonly used self-administered questionnaires are the Paffenbarger College Alumni Questionnaire [48] and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [49]. The former is a postal mail questionnaire that assesses the frequency and duration of walking, stari climbing, and sports and recreational activities performed in the past week. Adjustments are made for the number of weeks per year during which the sports and recreational activities are performed. A summary score (physical activity index) in kilocalories per week is computed from the intensity, frequency in days per week, and duration in hours or minutes per event for each activity recalled. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire assesses the hours per day and days per week spent in various moderate and vigorous intensity activities, walking activities, and sedentary activities. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire has been evaluated in international settings and is available for download in various languages at www.ipaq.ki.se.  \n",
      "Scoring protocols for recall questionnaires vary widely, ranging from simple ordinal scales that reflect participation levels (inactive, insufficiently active, sufficiently active, highly active) to comprehensive scores that reflect the intensity, frequency, and duration of reported activities (METminutes, MET-hours, kilocalories). Many studies have assessed the reliability and validity of recall questionnaires; most have 1-month test-retest reliability in cross-sectional settings on the order of r = 0.60 to 0.75 and r = 0.30 for validity against actual measures of energy expenditure, activity monitors, and physical activity records [47].  \n",
      "Limitations in the use of recall questionnaires relate to errors in recall that may result in biased measures of physical activity. For example, Rzewnicki and colleagues [50] noted overreporting of vigorous activities on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire when it was compared with other physical activity assessment methods. This suggests that care be taken in selecting selfadministered questionnaires as the primary method of measuring physical activity, especially if the purpose is to assess changes in physical activity in research studies.\n",

      "Interview-administered recall questionnaires provide information about the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity performed during a brief period in the past, ranging from 24 hours to 7 days. Technically, any self-administered physical activity recall questionnaire can be  \n",
      "administered by an interviewer. This is often the case when the study involves low-literacy populations. Interview protocols differ from self-administered physical activity recall questionnaires in that they generally use a series of questions and probes asked by a trained interviewer over the telephone or in person. As a participant answers the interviewer's questions, the information is recorded on a form tailored for the specific setting. The advantage of this interview method is that clarification can be obtained about a person's physical activity and a great deal of detail can be obtained about all elements of the behavior.  \n",
      "Two of the most common interview-administered physical activity recall protocols are the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall and the Previous Day Physical Activity Recall. The Seven Day Physical Activity Recall is one of the most widely used and validated measures of self-reported physical activity [9], and has undergone several revisions [51,52]. It has been used with adults [53], minorities [54,55], and adolescents [56]. Participants are asked to recall their sleep, and moderate, hard, and very hard physical activities for morning, afternoon, and evening hours in the past 7 days. Activities are then summarized in 10- to 15-minute blocks in weekend, weekday, work, and nonwork categories.  \n",
      "The Previous Day Physical Activity Recall was developed for use with school-aged children [57,58]. Older children can self-administer this recall method, but, for younger children (less than 10 years old), the Previous Day Physical Activity Recall is administered by an interviewer. Physical and sedentary activities are recorded in 30-minute blocks by type and intensity, using a list of activities and illustrations to help children with their self-report.  \n",
      "As with self-administered recall questionnaires, recall interviews of physical activity are affected substantially from recall bias. This is especially problematic with moderate intensity activities that do not seem to make the same impression in participant memories as more intense physical activities [59]. Evidence suggests that activities recalled from the first day in the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall are not any more accurate than those recalled from the last day in the interview [54]. This is primarily because of the extensive probing and memory cues used in the interview protocol. In addition, no studies using the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall in the elderly have been published. Although decrements in memory occur with advanced age, the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall protocol lends itself well to a variety of memory-enhancement exercises [59] that could substantially improve physical activity recall in this group of adults.\n",

      "Quantitative history questionnaires assess physical activity for a long period in the past, usually from 1 year to a lifetime, and assess the frequency and duration of multiple types of physical activity. The questionnaires may be age or activity specific [60-63] and may be used to assess physical activity behaviors associated with specific outcomes such as cancer [64] or cardiovascular disease [65].  \n",
      "A well-known quantitative history questionnaire is the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire used in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial [66] and in various other settings [47]. The Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire is an intervieweradministered questionnaire that has respondents check one of 74 activities performed within the past year. For each activity checked, respondents indicate the number of months per year, times per month, and average hours and minutes during which they were active.  \n",
      "To date, only one quantitative history questionnaire has proven effective in demonstrating physical activity changes in response to behavior change interventions [63]: the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed to assess changes in the weekly frequency and duration of various physical activities performed by older men and women. The questionnaire has adequate validity and reliability and is stable in measuring physical activity over a 6-month period [63].  \n",
      "Quantitative history recall questionnaires are limited by the difficulty in validating the questionnaires because it is often impossible to obtain objective measures of physical activity from long periods in the past, especially for instruments that assess lifetime physical activity. Reliability is generally acceptable [47,64]. Lifetime questionnaires have the greatest utility in the study of the impact of physical activity on diseases that have a long latency period between the exposure and outcomes, such as cancer and osteoporosis.\n",

      "Despite advancements in the quantitative assessment of physical activity, researchers still do not understand why some adults engage in physical activity and others do not. Physical activity researchers have also had great difficulty to date creating culturally appropriate and age- and genderspecific instruments. Part of the reason for this is that they are not engaging in systematic instrument development with populations who are consistently identified as physically inactive [5]. Instead, researchers often use whatever seems to have the highest published validity, reliability, and ease of use and then \"adapt\" it for use with the studied populations. This may be ineffective when they are trying to identify physical activity patterns of distinct population groups [67].  \n",
      "Qualitative data collection methods are particularly suited to the study of physical activity behaviors in understudied populations. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews are two of many qualitative data collection methods. Focus groups have their foundations in business market research and are conducted in groups of eight to ten participants purposely selected from the target population to come together and discuss a particular topic area [68]. A group moderator guides participants through a brief script of approximately three to five questions about a particular topic, with probes used to better understand the responses. Traditionally, the focus groups are audio-recorded (sometimes also videotaped) and then the audiotapes are transcribed verbatim for later analysis. Several studies have used this approach to explore physical activity in a variety of ethnic groups [5,69] and then used the information to develop quantitative surveys to measure physical activity [70].  \n",
      "The best self-report tool that currently exists for exploring the determinants of physical activity in a culturally relevant way is the life-history ethnographic interview [71]. Although developed for cultural anthropology investigations, this procedure has increasingly been applied to the study of health-related behaviors [72.73]. Much of the work in this area has focused on elucidating explanatory models of health and disease in minority cultures [74]. Investigators have applied ethnographic interviewing to the study of ethnic minority women's explanatory models of weight management [72,75] and physical activity [75,76].\n",

      "Many methods to assess physical activity in research and practice settings have been presented. The methods vary in complexity and the amount of information given. The use of a specific instrument should reflect the needs for the research or practice setting. For population studies and national surveillance systems, global or short-recall questionnaires are the preferred method because they are short, easy for respondents to understand, and relatively simple to score. On the other hand, experimental studies are better suited for the use of activity momitors, physical activity records and logs, and/or observation systems to assess physical activity because they provide a higher level of precision needed to quantify the effects of the intervention in modifying physical activity behaviors. Using a combination of questionnaires and direct methods to assess physical activity will substantially increase the amount of information obtained about a target population's physical activity. Finally, when working with a new population, it is best to begin with qualitative data collection methods to assess physical activity and then proceed to tailored instrument creation,  \n",

      "Numerous methods to assess physical activity provide information about the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of an activity performed. Ideally, direct methods of physical activity assessment should be used instead of indirect methods because they avoid bias associated with poor recall. However, it is not always possible to use direct methods based on the setting and study design. When questionnaires are used to assess physical activity, care should be taken to use instruments with the highest validity and reliability for the population group to be studied. Furthermore, questionnaires that are effective in detecting changes in physical activity behaviors should be used in pre-post experimental study designs. When possible, combinations of direct and indirect methods should be used to maximize the information obtained about participants' physical activity.\n",

      "Obesity is an established risk factor for cancer and other chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes [1-3]. The prevalence of obesity is increasing among youths and adults in developed [4] and developing [5] countries. Presently, there is no precise clinical definition of obesity based on actual measures of body fat because of the difficulty of collecting such data. Consensus exists for an indirect measure of body fat, called body mass index (BMI). BMI is easily obtained and reliable for overweight and obese persons, and several studies [6,7] have shown that BMI is highly correlated with percent body fat.  \n",
      "In 1997, the World Health Organization developed a classification system for overweight and obesity based on grades of BMI values related to increasing risk of comorbidity. A BMI of between 25 and 29 was defined as overweight and a BMI of ≥ 30 was defined as obesity [8]. Recent estimates indicate that 34% of the adult American population is overweight and that 31% are obese [9].  \n",
      "The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults and children in the United States and around the world [10] has highlighted the need for accurate and reliable methods to assess body fat levels. An accurate assessment of body fat is necessary to identify properly a patient's health risk associated with an excessively low or high relative body fat. This assessment can then be used to estimate a patient's ideal body weight and develop an exercise and diet program. Periodic body fat measurements can be used to assess the effectiveness of exercise and diet interventions or monitor changes in body fat associated with growth or disease states. Thus, accurate and precise assessment methods that are sensitive enough to track small changes in body fat are essential for assessing the effects of intervention programs designed to decrease body fat.  \n",
      "Within the last decade, the accuracy and availability of body fat methodology has improved. Because body fat has been linked to numerous health conditions, there is a clinical need to measure percent body fat and fat distribution as well. Whatever the reason for assessing body fat, health educators, exercise physiologists, nutritionists, and other clinicians should have a general understanding of the most commonly used techniques for assessing body fat. A variety of methods are available to assess body fat, some direct and some less direct. Direct methods - also referred to in this chapter as laboratory-based methods - are used primarily in clinical research centers where accurate and precise measurements are essential. Methods such as densitometry, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound are examples of direct methods.  \n",
      "Indirect methods, also referred to in this chapter as field-based methods, provide estimates of body fat. These methods are based on assumptions regarding the density of fat mass and fat-free mass and the concentrations of water and electrolytes in the body. The accuracy and precision of indirect methods depend on their validation against results from direct methods. The adaptability and ease of use with large groups makes indirect methods applicable in epidemiological studies and in public health and obesity screening programs. Body weight, BMI, circumferences, skinfolds, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) are examples of indirect methods.  \n",
      "The definition of laboratory or field methods can be somewhat arbitrary, but it is usually bound by the available resources, type and quality of information sought, and location of the study. Some other factors that should be considered when defining an ideal body fat method are: cost, training of operator, maintenance and operating costs, precision, and accuracy. If only weight and height are of interest, for example, these data can be obtained using only a scale and tape measure, and the sophisticated technologies described in the following sections are not needed. However, if the objective is to determine the body's fat mass or its internal (e.g., visceral, intramuscular) component, the more robust methods must be used.  \n",
      "The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of selected body fat methods that are most likely to be used in the lab or field for assessing body fat in large-scale epidemiological, clinical, or anthropometrical studies, examine their validity and reliability, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each method. The chapter is subdivided into laboratory methods and field methods. Several advanced methods, such as neutron activation, gamma resonance absorption, or whole-body potassium counting will not be presented here because they are not routinely used in human body fat studies [11]. Information beyond that presented in this chapter can be found in textbooks [12] and other peer-reviewed manuscripts [13,14].\n",

      "The most common laboratory methods for body fat assessment involve densitometry and imaging methods. These methods cannot be considered field methods for body fat analysis because of the high initial capital investment, the need for a highly trained technical staff, and the high annual maintenance and service costs. However, many scientists consider these methods the gold standards for precision and accuracy for body fat measurements.\n",

      "The classical method of assessing body fat in vivo is densitometry. This method assumes that the body consists of two compartments, the fat mass (FM) and the fat free mass (FFM), so that weight = fat mass + fat free mass, each with its own specific and assumed constant density: 0.9007 g/cm³ and 1.1000 g/cm³, respectively. Determining the density of the body allows a calculation of the ratio of fat mass to fat free mass (the lower the density is, the more body fat a subject has); when body weight is known, the absolute and relative amounts of fat mass and fat free mass can be calculated. Density is weight divided by volume, and the methods that are now used to determine body volume are hydrodensitometry (also called underwater weighing. UWW) and air displacement plethysmography. Underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography are strictly bound to a laboratory setting because the instruments are not portable.\n",

      "Hydrodensitometry or underwater weighing was developed mainly as a means to measure body density to assess body fat. Because of its early development and widespread use, the measurement of body density, via underwater weighing, is often referred to as a gold standard for body fat measurements. Underwater weighing is based on Archimedes' principle: a body immersed in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid; thus, if a person's weight is measured in air and then when completely immersed in water, density can be calculated: density (g/cm²) = weight (g)/volume (cm³) = weight of body in air (g)/weight of body in air (g) – weight of body in water (g). Thus, underwater weighing, as the name implies, requires the subject to be completely submerged in water [15]. Additionally, the subject needs to remain relatively motionless underwater in order for a trained technician to get an accurate reading of the subject's underwater weight.  \n",
      "This procedure must be repeated multiple times for a valid and reliable reading. Generally, it is repeated until three trials within 100 g of each other are obtained. The average of these three trials is used as the underwater weighing for the calculation of body density [16]. Further adjustments are needed for water density, which depends on water temperature, and the volume of air in the respiratory system when the underwater weight is measured. This latter volume is normally the ventilated residual volume. The body density formula [17] is: body density = [(weight in air weight in water)/water density] - residual volume. Body density is then converted to percent body fat using regression equations developed by Siri [18] or Brozek et al. [19]. For example, using Brozek's equation, if body weight (kg) is equal to unity with the two compartments represented as proportions such that fat mass - fat free mass = 1, then: 1/bone density = fat mass density + fat free mass/fat free mass density. Using densities of 0.9007 [20] and 1.100 g/cm³ [21] for fat mass and fat free mass, respectively, it can be shown that: % fat mass = [4.57/bone density] - 4.142 × 100. Body fat as a percentage of body weight calculated from the Siri equation is: % fat = [4.95/bone density – 4.50] × 100. The Siri and Brozek equations produce values within 1% body fat of each other.  \n",
      "For the residual volume correction, the recommended method is oxygen dilution with a closedcircuit spirometer system [22]. However, residual volume is not routinely performed but instead approximated using prediction equations. Unfortunately, predicted residual volume can result in residual volume variations that affect the estimation of percent body fat by as much as 8% [23]. Therefore, residual volume should not be predicted from age, height, body weight, or vital capacity. By comparison, errors associated with incorrect underwater weights and body weight fluctuations due to factors affecting hydration status are not as large, with a 2- to 3-kg weight fluctuation producing a change in relative body fat of only 1% [24]. Regarding the total cumulative error for percent body fat, it has been estimated to be on the order of 3 to 4% of body weight for the individual [25].  \n",
      "A major potential source of measurement error for this method is the formula used to convert body density to body fat. For years, the classic two-component models of Siri and Brozek have been the basis of underwater weighing estimates of % body fat. Both conversion formulas were based on direct analysis of a limited number of white male and female cadavers that did not necessarily represent the entire population. The Siri and Brozek conversion formulas assume that the density of fat mass and fat free mass density are constant for all individuals. Research documents that fat free mass density is not constant for all individuals, but rather varies with age, gender, body fatness, physical activity, and race/ethnicity [26]. Fat free mass changes from birth onward and the density of the fat free mass is thus likely not \"constant\" across the lifespan. Because of these limitations, underwater weighing cannot be considered a gold standard method. However, regarding precision, Ward et al. [27] reported good test-retest reliability (r = 0.99).  \n",
      "Underwater weighing has many flaws and may not be a practical technique for many subjects. Because subjects are required to exhale completely while submerged, this difficult maneuver requires a great deal of cooperation by the subject and the overall measurement period is quite time consuming (e.g., ~10 trials for a total of ~30 min). Another limitation of underwater weighing is that it is difficult for an overweight or obese person to submerge. Underwater weighing also may not be easy to undertake with elderly or physically disabled persons or individuals with diseases. Furthermore, to ensure an accurate measure of body volume from underwater weighing, residual volume requires a skilled technician and is difficult, and sometimes impossible, for some subjects to perform. Lastly, the underwater weighing instrumentation is priced moderately and requires high maintenance and a well-trained operator. These limitations have shown that this method is not suited for laboratory-based body fat methods.\n",

      "The overall density of the human body may be measured using water displacement, i.e., underwater weighing, or air displacement. For years, UWW has been considered by some experts as a gold standard method. However, because of the limitations noted earlier, a new technique for measuring body density and, in turn, body fat has been developed has the potential to become a field method. The instrument used is the Bod Pod® (Life Measurement Instruments, Inc., Concord, CA). The Bod Pod is a large, egg-shaped fiberglass chamber. This method is based on air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and uses the relationship between pressure and volume to derive body volume. The physical design and the operating principles of air displacement plethysmography have been described in detail elsewhere [28].  \n",
      "The instrument [28] consists of two chambers; the subject sits in one chamber and the other serves as a reference. With the subject in one chamber, the door is closed and sealed, the pressure increased slightly, and a diaphragm, separating the two chambers, is oscillated to alter the volumes slightly. The classic relationship of pressure vs. volume at a fixed temperature is used to solve for the volume of the subject chamber. The volumes of the two chambers are varied slightly and the difference in air pressure is recorded. The subject's body volume is calculated using corrections for isothermal properties of the air in the lungs and near the skin's surface.  \n",
      "From the subject's perspective, the procedures are quite simple. Wearing minimal clothing (e.g., a bathing suit) so as not to alter body surface area calculations, swim cap (to minimize isothermal air trapped within the hair), and nose clip. the subject enters and sits in the fiberglass chamber for two trials of approximately 45 sec each. The Bod Pod is sealed, and the subject breathes normally for 20 sec while body volume is measured. The subject is then connected to a breathing tube that is connected to the reference chamber in the rear of the Bod Pod to measure thoracic gas volume. The subject resumes tidal breathing through the tube. After three breathing cycles, a valve in the circuit momentarily occludes the airway. At this point, the subject gently \"puffs\" by alternately contracting and relaxing the diaphragm. This effort produces small pressure fluctuations in the airway and chamber that are used to determine thoracic gas volume. This value is used to correct  \n",
      "body volume for thoracic gas volume. The body volume is equal to the volume of air in an empty chamber minus the volume of air remaining in the chamber after the subject enters it. The percent body fat is then calculated using the Siri equation [18].  \n",
      "Studies using air displacement plethysmography have shown very good agreement with the underwater weighing method in healthy adults and children [29,30]. This may prove to be a more valid and reliable method than underwater weighing, especially for older adults, physically challenged individuals, and those afraid of being submerged underwater. Air displacement plethysmography has been reported to be a highly reliable method for determining percent body fat in adult humans [31]. Although not significantly different, the same-day test-retest reliability of the air displacement plethysmography was slightly better than it was for underwater weighing, with the average coefficients of variation being 1.7 and 2.3% for air displacement plethysmography and underwater weighing, respectively. The mean difference in percent body fat between the two methods was only 0.3% (r = 0.96, SEE = 1.81%). However, at the individual level differences were quite large, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -9% to +7% body fat [32].  \n",
      "Air displacement plethysmography is a quicker, more convenient, and an easier test to administer than underwater weighing (i.e., less technical expertise required); therefore, it has the potential to reduce technician error. The air displacement plehtysmography method involves little effort on the part of the subject, thereby reducing within-subject error. Another advantage is that the subject does not need to be submerged under water, although he or she still needs to wear a swimsuit and cap. Another advantage is that the measurement time is only a few minutes.  \n",
      "Disadvantages or limitations of air displacement plethysmography are that the devices of this method are limited to persons who are \"moderately\" obese at best - i.e., someone with a BMI > 30 may be difficult to assess. Another major drawback of air displacement plethysmography is the high cost of the instrument [33]. The same assumptions for converting body density to percent body fat that limit underwater weihing also exist for air displacement plethysmography. Thus, even if all the technical limitations can be corrected, the question of the physiological accuracy of using a common fat free mass density among individuals still remains. The assumption of a fixed density will produce a larger error of fat free mass than the cumulative technical errors associated with the density measurement. Thus, without additional knowledge of the density of the fat free mass, underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography techniques may best serve to identify outliers in a population.\n",

      "Three major techniques are used for imaging of the body: dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many scientists consider these methods the standards for precision and accuracy for body fat measurements [34.35]. Furthermore, DEXA, CT, and MRI provide the only presently fully accepted approach for measuring body fat distribution [36]. However, a significant advantage of CT and MRI is the ability to assess not only abdominal body fat, but also the important visceral adipose tissue compartment and intramuscular fat - information that is presently not available with any other body fat methods. Recently, ultrasound has been used as a technique for assessing body fat, specifically visceral adipose tissue.\n",

      "DEXA is a relatively new technique developed in the 1980s mainly to diagnose osteoporosis. When DEXA is applied, a subject, lying supine on a padded table, is scanned (two-dimensionally) from head to toe with x-rays of two energy levels [37]. Based on the different attenuation coefficients of minerals and soft tissue on the one hand, and of soft tissue between lean mass and fat mass on the other, the composition of the body can be calculated in terms of bone mineral, lean tissue, and  \n",
      "fat tissue. Fat mass, as well as bone mineral content and lean tissue mass, is derived according to computer algorithms provided by the manufacturer [38]. Most important, the attenuation of soft tissue can now be measured rather than assumed, as is the case with underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography. The average skin dose of radiation is 1 to 3 mrad per DEXA scan [39], which is comparable to the skin exposure from a week of environmental background radiation (about 3.5 mrad/week) [40].  \n",
      "At present, three manufacturers provide DEXA devices measuring body fat: Hologic Inc. (Waltham, MA), Lunar Radiation Corp (Madison, WI), and Norland Medical Systems (Fort Atkinson, WI). The DEXA instruments from different manufacturers are unique in implementation but based on the same theoretical principles. DEXA devices are composed principally of a generator emitting x-rays of two energies, a scanning table, a detector, and a computer system. The fundamental physical principle behind DEXA is presented in a review by Genton et al. [41]. Percent body fat has been shown to vary among manufacturers [42], the data collection mode (pencil beam vs. array beam), and the software version used to analyze the data [43].  \n",
      "Only the DEXA manufacturers have developed standard software that can measure body fat. Furthermore, the physical limitations of weight, length, thickness, and width also vary with each manufacturer and type of DEXA machine. For example, weight limitations are 100 and 136 kg for current Lunar and Hologic machines, respectively, and appropriate for a person of average height (178 cm) and a maximum BMI of between 31 and 43. However, these manufacturers have a body width restriction of about 60 to 66 cm, and Lunar has a body thickness limit of 26 cm. These limits are a function of the available table scan area of the machines. Thus, bodies of many obese individuals are too wide or thick to receive a whole-body DEXA scan with current machines, although some innovative adaptations, such as scanning an obese person twice, have been proposed [44].  \n",
      "Although DEXA was originally used to measure bone density and total body fat, recent improvements in software allow it to determine abdominal fat mass. Glickman et al. [45] examined the validity and reliability of DEXA to measure abdominal fat accurately in 65 men and women aged 18 to 72 using a Lunar DPX-IQ scanner. Multislice CT scans were performed between L1 and L4 vertebral bodies. Abdominal total tissue mass (7.07 ± 1.96 kg vs. 7.48 ± 1.87 kg, p = 0.02) and abdominal fat mass (2.22 ± 1.63 kg vs. 2.99 ± 1.99 kg, p < .0001) were significantly lower as measured by DEXA compared to CT. However, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good concordance between DEXA and CT for abdominal total tissue mass (i.e., limits of agreement = - 1.56 to 2.54 kg) and fat mass (i.e., limits of agreement = −0.40 to 1.94 kg). DXA also showed excellent reliability (R = 0.94 and 0.97 for total abdominal and abdominal fat mass).  \n",
      "Although DEXA was found to be reliable and reproducible in the estimation of abdominal adipose tissue, it does not allow the visual distinction between visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue. However, combining DEXA and waist circumference data accounted for 84% of the variance in CT-derived visceral adipose tissue (VAT), providing researchers with a method to estimate VAT using DEXA. The equation to predict VAT is: VAT (g) = DEXA L1-L4 fat mass (0.31) + WC (7.03).  \n",
      "DEXA is highly reliable, with repeated measurements over 1 day in the same subject demonstrating CVs of about 0.8% for fat [46]. Mazess et al. [47] reported excellent short-term precision for DEXA. Ten measurements each on 12 subjects were conducted over a period of 1 week. The authors reported a precision error for fat mass equal to 1.4%. The short- and long-term precision of DEXA was assessed by Johnson and Dawson–Hughes [48]. They scanned subjects six times initially and then again 9 months later. The CV for fat mass was 2.7% at the start of the study and 1.7% after 9 months.  \n",
      "Many studies have now examined DEXA accuracy in animals and humans. DEXA fat estimates in species ranging widely in body size are highly correlated with corresponding criterion estimates, such as chemical analysis of cadavers. Good agreement is also present between percent body fat estimates obtained by underwater weighing and DEXA [49]. In studies that compared underwater weighing to DEXA, investigators have found DEXA to be a better predictor of mean percent body  \n",
      "fat than underwater weighing [50]. DEXA may have the greatest sensitivity to changes in body fat with exercise. In a study by Houtkooper et al. [51] in which postmenopausal women (n = 76) were exercise-trained, SDs for changes in body fat were the smallest for DEXA estimates. Consequently, the estimates of percent body fat from DEXA had the smallest variability and therefore, when compared with results from underwater weighing, were the most sensitive measures for detecting small changes in body fat in this sample of women.  \n",
      "The DEXA model is an important advance in body fat methodology. DEXA is an attractive alternative to underwater weighing and air displacement plethysmography as a reference method because it is a safe, noninvasive method that involves only a small radiation dose and is accurate and precise [52]. DEXA is rapid (most scans are completed in 10 min), requires minimal subject cooperation, and, most importantly, accounts for individual variability in fat free mass. It is also less affected by and therefore less prone to the errors associated with the underlying assumptions inherent in UWW and ADP. DEXA evaluations are relatively inexpensive to carry out. The greatest advantage of DEXA over other laboratory methods may be the ability to assess regional as well as total body fat and analyze separate compartments of the body.  \n",
      "Because DEXA does not rely on the assumption of a two-component model (i.e., fat mass and fat free mass) to provide estimates of body fat and does not depend on subject performance, it is sometimes regarded as a standard against which other methods can be validated. However, like most other methods for measuring body fat, DEXA is also subject to errors [53]. Limitations of DEXA are the high initial capital investment, the need for a highly trained technical staff, and the high annual maintenance and service costs. Also, tissue depth has an impact on the total attenuation of the body, so the method has different accuracy in obese persons compared with lean persons [54]. In summary, owing to its nature, the method is not suitable for most field studies. Nevertheless, DEXA is a safe, quick, accurate, and reliable method for measuring body fat in the majority of the population.\n",

      "CT has been considered the most accurate and reproducible technique of body fat measurement [55], particularly abdominal adipose tissue. Since 1990, CT has been proposed as the gold standard method to quantify abdominal obesity [55]. Despres and Lamarche [56] observed that a visceral fat area of 130 cm2 was associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events in 213 men and 190 women. More recently, a visceral adipose tissue ≥ 106 cm² was associated with an elevated risk [57] in 233 persons.  \n",
      "The use of CT and MRI (see later section) allows for three-dimensional information of body fat. In contrast to DEXA, the information is obtained on a tissue level, rather than a chemical level, so adipose tissue rather than chemical body fat is determined. For comparison, adipose tissue can be converted to body fat assuming that 80% of adipose tissue is fat. CT and MRI can be used to get information on total body fat; however, because of the radiation and/or price of measurements, they are usually used to obtain information on body fat distribution (employing single scans at the L4-L5 level).  \n",
      "From the subject's perspective. CT is quite simple. The subject lies on a padded table for scanning. One scan is usually performed using a lateral-view radiograph of the skeleton (abdominal area) to establish the position of the L4-L5 space within 1.0 mm. A second scan is then performed at the L4–L5 space (at 125 kV and with a slice thickness of 8 mm). Ideally, following the scanning. one technician then measures the subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat areas using a commercial software application (e.g., Slice-O-Matic from Tomovision, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) that identifies and measures each of the areas of interest by tracing lines around them and computing the circumscribed areas.  \n",
      "Although available for nearly 30 years, CT was only minimally applied in body fat research because of expense and radiation exposure [58]. The importance of CT is that the method produces  \n",
      "cross-sectional images of tissue-system level components at predefined anatomic locations, via a rotating x-ray tube and detector, which moves in a perpendicular plane to the subject. The CT x-rays are attenuated as they penetrate tissues and Fourier analysis or filtered back projection is used in reconstructing the image. Image analysis software then allows estimation of the adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and other tissue-system level component pixels, or \"picture elements,\" translate to respective tissue areas. The CT number assigned to each pixel is a measure of photon attenuation relative to air and water [59]. Air, adipose tissue, nonadipose lean tissues, and skeleton pixels all have characteristic CT number ranges. Acquiring images at predefined intervals and then integrating tissue component areas permits reconstruction of whole-body components such as skeletal muscle mass [60].  \n",
      "CT can now quantify the mass of all major organs and tissues. The CT images can also be used to separate the total adipose tissue mass into its subcutaneous and visceral components, or the lean tissues into skeletal muscle and visceral or organ mass.  \n",
      "Reconstruction of total body mass and separate organ masses based on scans along the length of the body at 10-cm intervals has been shown to have excellent accuracy (<1% error) and precision (<1%) [61]. It has also been shown that CT provides a more accurate determination of visceral adipose tissue than MRI does (see next section) [62]. Extensive validation studies for CT include human and animal cadavers. Rossner et al. [63] compared adipose tissue estimates by CT with corresponding planimetry measurements of corresponding band-sawed slices from two male cadavers. Strong correlations were present between the two types of area estimates (r = 0.77 to 0.94).  \n",

      "MRI is based on interaction between nuclei of hydrogen atoms and magnetic fields produced and controlled by the MRI's instrumentation. Protons have a magnetic moment that causes them to function as small magnets. Under usual conditions in the earth's weak magnetic field, these magnetic moments are randomly oriented, and they tend to cancel each other. When a subject is placed inside the scanner's high-field strength magnet proton, magnetic moments tend to align longitudinally to the external magnet's field. A pulsed radio-frequency field is then applied to body tissues, causing some of the aligned hydrogen protons to absorb energy [64]. Several excellent reviews of the practical aspects of the MRI measurement have been presented previously [65.66].  \n",
      "To obtain MRI data, the subject is positioned in the magnet's bore in a prone or supine position. Typically, a 320-mm region of the body is imaged in a single acquisition. The time required to obtain multiple (i.e., seven) images is the same as that required to obtain a single image. Therefore, in most MRI studies, multiple images of a given region are obtained in a single acquisition. Depending on the pulse frequency used, the time needed for an abdominal image can take 8 to 10 min or more, although recent technological advances may have reduced this time to ~30 sec per slice [67]. For a whole-body measurement, a series of multiple scans along the length of the body is needed, which may require the subject to be in the magnet's bore for 30 min or longer.  \n",
      "Cross-sectional abdominal images obtained with MRI allow for separation of the SAT from the visceral adipose tissue compartment. The coefficient of variation for repeated measures of subcutaneous adipose tissue ranges from 1 to 10% [68]. The coefficient of variation for visceral adipose tissue estimates is higher — 6 to 11% — as a result of measurement errors associated with respiratory motion. Human cadaver studies were used by Abate et al. [69] to examine the validity of MRI SAT and visceral adipose tissue estimates. The overall agreement between dissection weight and MRI-estimated adipose tissue weights was 6% or 0.08 kg.  \n",
      "Some consideration should be given to whether to use CT or MRI to characterize the adipose tissue content and distribution in humans. There is generally good agreement between CT- and MRI-derived measures of regional body fat [70], and both methods are highly reproducible and reliable [71,72]. The lower coefficient of variation of CT compared to MRI is usually ascribed to a shorter image acquisition time, and CT is thus less vulnerable to image artifacts produced by gastrointestinal tract movement [73].  \n",
      "A limitation to CT and MRI is that access to the scanners is limited and cost in most centers is prohibitive. Additionally, the time required for analysis of the images can be substantial. Although the scan times for CT are shorter than for MRI, with MRI there is no ionizing radiation, making the acquisition of multiple images more practical. However, if the pixel resolution required for routine CT scans can be relaxed, the dose can be significantly reduced. Studies have shown that a ten-scan image of the trunk region can be obtained with an effective dose of <0.3 mSv, which is about 1/25 that of a routine clinical CT scan [74]. It would be quite difficult to collect MRI and CT data from many of the obese because they are too large for the opening in the magnet or the scanner. In summary, CT and MRI provide the only presently fully accepted approach for estimating the important visceral adipose tissue compartment [36].\n",

      "CT and MRI have been considered the most accurate and reproducible techniques of body fat measurement, particularly abdominal adipose tissue. However, both are costly and time-consuming measures and involve exposure to radiation. Because of these limitations, alternative methods, such as ultrasound, are being used to assess fat distribution and to estimate intra-abdominal fat deposition.  \n",
      "In 1990, Armellini et al. [75] proposed the use of ultrasound for the quantification of visceral adiposity as an alternative technique to CT. Ultrasound allows the individual visualization of subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. In addition, ultrasound is a noninvasive and quick method with good reproducibility rates (<1%) and lower costs than CT scans [76]. However, specific equipment and a well-trained examiner are required. Ultrasonography is performed using a highresolution ultrasonographic system and a 7.5- or 3.5-MHz probe. Subjects are examined in the supine position with all frozen images obtained immediately after respiration to avoid the influence of the respiratory status.  \n",
      "Recently, Ribeiro–Filho et al. [76] compared ultrasound for the assessment of visceral adipose tissue as an alternative to CT and also to establish cut-off values to define visceral adiposity based on ultrasound. The study enrolled 100 women, 20 to 65 years of age. Ultrasound procedures were performed using a 3.5-MHz probe located 1 cm from the umbilicus. Two ultrasound measurements of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat were taken. The coefficient of variation for ultrasound was 0.8%. A correlation of r = 0.71 (p < .0001) was found between CT-determined visceral fat and ultrasound. Total fat (visceral plus subcutaneous) determined by ultrasound correlated with total fat area determined by CT (r = 0.65, p < . 001).  \n",
      "Similar correlations were observed in studies by Kim et al. [77] and Stolk et al. [78]. Visceral obesity by ultrasound showed a diagnostic concordance of 74% with CT. An ultrasound value of 6.90 cm for visceral distance was found as a diagnostic cut-off for visceral obesity. A noninvasive and less expensive method such as ultrasound may facilitate identification of high-risk patients and allow earlier interventions.\n",

      "A number of methods are available for field purposes. Field methods rely on statistical relationships between easily measurable parameters and a method of reference (e.g., lab-based methods). The validity of these methods is less compared with the laboratory methods, mainly because more assumptions are made on top of those already held for the method of reference. The advantage is that the method is portable and inexpensive, although information on an individual level is not very valid or reliable.\n",

      "Body mass index (BMI), defined as weight/height², is the most commonly used field method. For population studies, BMI is generally accepted as a measure of body fatness [79]. Body weight is usually measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a beam balance and body height is usually measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer.  \n",
      "The World Health Organization cut-off points of BMI for overweight and obesity are based on observational studies of the relationship between BMI and morbidity (in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and mortality [80]. Because no studies relate directly measured body fat to morbidity and mortality, no clear cut-off points for obesity, based on body fat measurements, are known. Based on the relationship between BMI and percent body fat, one can calculate that, in adults, a BMI value of 30 corresponds to about 25% body fat in males and 35% body fat in females [81]. Because body fat generally increases and fat free mass decreases with increasing age, older subjects will have a higher percent body fat than young subjects of the same BMI [82].  \n",
      "Variations in percent body fat for the same BMI may also be caused by variations in physical activity, fitness, body build, diet, and race or ethnicity [83]. For the same BMI, physically inactive or unfit men and women on average have slightly greater fat mass than physically active or fit men and women [84]. Exercise intervention studies have also demonstrated that, when performed for a sufficient duration, aerobic exercise in the absence of a change in BMI is associated with reductions in total fat mass [85], subcutaneous adipose tissue [86], and visceral adipose tissue [87]. In studies by Irwin et al. [88] and Janssen et al. [89], aerobic exercise training with little or no change in body weight or BMI was associated with significant reductions in total fat mass and visceral adipose tissue fat.  \n",
      "Although the World Health Organization and U.S. Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommend BMI as a measure of percent body fat [90], recent findings have challenged the assumption that BMI has the same meaning in all racial or ethnic groups [91]. A recent metaanalysis of the relationship between BMI and percent body fat among Chinese, Ethiopians, Indonesians, Polynesians, Thais, American blacks, and American whites revealed that people of different ethnic groups had significantly different BMIs at the same levels of body fat, age, and gender [92]. Possible reasons for ethnic differences in the relationship between BMI and percent body fat include differences in fat free mass, the distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and limb length relative to trunk size [93]. These findings suggest that estimates of body fat from BMI may produce systematic errors across different ethnic groups.  \n",
      "The distinct advantages of using BMI to assess body fat are that it is portable, noninvasive, and inexpensive; requires little training and little maintenance and operating costs; and is very precise (if measured). Other advantages of BMI are that it has available extensive national reference data, has established direct relationships with levels of body fat and with morbidity and mortality, and is highly predictive of future risk for overweight and obesity. Weight and BMI are useful in monitoring the treatment of overweight and obesity because they are sensitive to positive progress in response to treatment. Weight is easily monitored and tracked at home. One clear advantage for using BMI in adults is that height remains somewhat constant during most of adulthood, so longitudinal examinations based on BMI reflect mainly changes in weight.  \n",
      "Limitations of BMI are that an increased BMI does not show which body compartment (fat or lean mass) is inadequate and cannot differentiate subcutaneous adipose tissue from visceral adipose tissue. Another limitation is the accuracy of BMI in assessing body fatness for the individual [94]. Measured body weight, height, and BMI are limited in accuracy; however, there is even greater concern related to self-reported estimates of these measures. Studies have shown that women and men, especially obese persons, tend to underreport their body weight and that men tend to overreport height [95.96]. Underreporting weight and overreporting height lead to an underestimate of BMI and body fat. In summary, although BMI has its limitations, it remains  \n",

      "Due to the ease and feasibility of body circumference measurements, they are often used in largescale epidemiological studies and when more elaborate methods of assessing body fat are unavailable. Circumference measurements involve placing a tape measure around a specific body segment. Using a flexible, plastic-coated tape measure with a spring-loaded handle enables the clinician to reproduce the tension on the end of the tape measure, thereby increasing reliability and precision. An often used tape measure, the Gulick II (Lafayette Instrument Co, Lafayette, IN) has a tension meter attached so that the tape's tension can be standardized during measurement. Several studies found that waist circumference is more closely associated with visceral adipose tissue than is either waist-hip-ratio or BMI [97,98]. In a guide about obesity treatment published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, waist circumference and BMI were suggested as the most available and reliable means of identifying obesity, establishing the risks related to it, and monitoring its treatment [99].  \n",
      "The U.S. National Institutes of Health guide suggests that the waist circumference measurement be taken just above the iliac crest. However, in the literature, 14 different descriptions of the site for waist circumference measurements exist [100,101]. Overall, these sites can be organized into four groups defined by specific anatomic landmarks:  \n",
      "- Immediately below the lowest ribs o\n",
      "- o At the narrowest waist\n",
      "- o At the midpoint between the lowest rib and iliac crest\n",
      "- o Immediately above the iliac crest  \n",
      "The narrowest waist is the most frequently recommended site. However for some subjects, there is no single narrowest point because of a large amount of abdominal fat or extreme thinness.  \n",
      "Wang et al. [102] made comparisons between waist circumference measurements at the four sites with the hope of developing a universally accepted method of measuring waist circumference. The reproducibility of the waist circumference measurements was very high for both sexes in all four sites. The Intra-class correlations (ICCs)were all r > 0.996. The four sites had CVs < 1%. An important finding of the study is that waist circumference values measured at any of the four commonly used sites are almost equally associated with total body fat and central fat in each sex.  \n",
      "Men and women with waist circumference values ≤ 102 and ≤ 88 cm, respectively, are considered to have a normal waist circumference, whereas men and women with waist circumference values > 102 and > 88 cm, respectively, are considered to have a high waist circumference [103]. However, Lemieux et al. [104] concluded that a waist circumference cut-off point of 100 cm should be used for subjects aged ≤ 40 years and 90 cm in subjects aged > 40 years for men and women. They based their calculation on the absolute amount of visceral fat measured using a CT scan and the cut-off point of 130 cm² as the reference value. The above-mentioned waist cutoff points best corresponded to the specified amount of visceral fat. However, of note is the fact that there are differences between waist circumference indices of visceral fat and the actual amount of visceral fat as measured by CT or MRI are different among different ethnic groups. Albu et al. [105] showed that, for the same amount of fat mass, obese black women had significantly less visceral fat and a lower visceral fat-to-subcutaneous fat ratio for any given waist–hip circumference ratio than white women.  \n",
      "Being meticulous with site location and measurement is critical for accurate and reliable measures. The reproducibility of waist circumference measurements at any site depends on the observer's skill. A potential source of measurement error for all waist circumference sites is incorrectly positioning the tape measure on the subject's body. It is critical that the observer position the tape around the subject's body in a plane that is perpendicular to the long axis of the body. Reproducibility can be increased by giving special attention to positioning the subject, using anatomic landmarks to locate measuring sites, taking readings with the tape measure directly in contact with the subject's skin without compression, and keeping the tape at 90 degrees to the long axis of the body |106|.  \n",
      "Given that most members of the population cannot readily calculate their BMI [107] and that this difficulty is compounded by the inaccuracy of self-reported height and weight measurements [95,96], waist circumference is a preferred measure of adiposity. Approximately 20% of adults are classified in the incorrect BMI category on the basis of self-reported height and weight [96]. By comparison, only 2% of men and women are classified in the incorrect waist circumference category (e.g., low, moderate, or high) on the basis of self-measured waist circumference [108].  \n",
      "In summary, strengths of using circumference measures are that they can always be measured regardless of body size or fatness. Waist circumference is strongly correlated with visceral adipose tissue and can easily be interpreted. This makes it a suitable candidate for an optimal indicator of abdominal obesity.\n",

      "The third most commonly used field method to assess body fatness is based on skinfold measurements of the subcutaneous fat layer using inexpensive calipers. Skinfold thickness is accepted as a body fatness predictor for two reasons: about 40 to 60% of total body fat is in the subcutaneous adipose tissue region of the body, and skinfold thickness can be directly measured using a wellcalibrated caliper. There are more than 19 sites for measuring skinfold thickness. The triceps site has been used more frequently than other sites because it is easy to access, is reproducible, and can measure wide differences among people. The skinfold technique involves pinching the skin with the thumb and forefinger, pulling it away from the body slightly, and placing the calipers on the fold. Thus, skinfold measures the thickness of two layers of skin and the underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue .  \n",
      "To standardize skinfold measurements, guidelines for anatomical location of skinfold sites and measurement technique have been published [109]. Four different calipers have been used: Adipometer, Harpenden, Holtain, and Lange. Lange is the most widely used. The calipers have been calibrated measuring ranges up to 60 mm. Interobserver error is a major issue in measuring skinfolds [110]. Standardized methodology, including positioning of the instrument, a well-trained data collector, and practicing until results are consistent, can increase reproducibility. Special attention to locating the site, grasping the skin, and assuring that the caliper is at a 90 degree angle relative to the grasped skinfold are essential for high reproducibility.  \n",
      "Due to its relative low cost and simplicity, the measurement of skinfold is a popular method of estimating body density; more than 100 skinfold prediction equations have been published. One of the most popular and widely used skinfold equations is that developed by Jackson and Pollock [111]. This generalized equation was developed on a heterogeneous sample of 308 men ranging in age from 18 to 61 years and cross-validated on a similar sample of 95 men. The regression model was developed from the sum of seven skinfold sites (chest, midaxillary, triceps, subscapula, abdomen, suprailium, and thigh, r = 0.90, SEE = 0.0078 g/cc). A high correlation was found between the sum of seven skinfold sites and the sum of three skinfold sites, so another equation using just three skinfold sites (chest, abdomen, and thigh) was developed (r = 0.91, SEE = 0.0077 g/cc). A similar model and generalized equations using the same sum of seven skinfold sites (r = 0.85, SEE = 0.0083 g/cc) and a different set of three skinfold sites (triceps, thigh, and suprailium, r = 0.84. SEE = 0.0086 g/cc) were developed from a heterogeneous sample of 249 women ages 18 to 55 years and cross-validated on a sample of 82 women [112].  \n",
      "Because the skinfold method indirectly measures the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue, certain basic relationships are assumed [113]. One is that skinfold is a good measure of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Hayes et al. [114] showed a good relationship between mean fat thickness estimated from 12 skinfold sites and MRI. For men, the correlations between skinfold and MRI (r = 0.88) was significant. A second assumption is that the distribution of the fat subcutaneously and internally is similar for all individuals. The validity of this assumption is questionable. Older subjects have less subcutaneous adipose tissue than their younger counterparts. Also, lean individuals have a higher proportion of internal fat, and the proportion of fat located internally decreases as overall body fatness increases [115]. Additionally, race could be a factor, with African Americans storing a greater percentage of total body fat internally compared to whites.  \n",
      "A third assumption for the skinfold method is that a good relationship exists between subcutaneous adipose tissue and total body fat. It is estimated that SAT makes up one third of total fat [116]. However, Lohman noted that subcutaneous adipose tissue can range from 20 to 70% of total body fat depending on such biological factors as age, sex, and degree of fatness. A fourth assumption is that a relationship is present between skinfold sites and body density. This relationship is linear for homogenous samples. A linear regression line will fit the data well only within a narrow range of body fatness values [117].  \n",
      "The precision of the skinfold data has been shown to be highly variable and operator dependent. The accuracy of this method has been questioned when assessing body fat of the individual. The accuracy and precision of skinfold measurements are affected by the technician's skill, type of skinfold caliper, and subject factors [118]. It is difficult, even for highly skilled technicians, to measure the skinfold thickness of obese individuals accurately. Often, the subject's skinfold thickness exceeds the maximum aperture of the caliper, and the jaws of the caliper may slip off the fold during the measurement. Therefore, skinfolds should not be used to measure body fat of obese subjects.  \n",
      "In summary, the skinfold method requires a considerable amount of technical skill, being meticulous with site location and measurement, and restriction to populations from whom the prediction equation was derived. Although it is an excellent field method to use on lean subjects, it is difficult to obtain reliable and accurate readings on older subjects with less connective tissue or obese individuals with large folds. The availability of skinfold calipers capable of larger measurements would not be a significant improvement because of the physical difficulty of picking up a very large skinfold on an obese adult.\n",

      "The bioelectrical impedance method is widely applied in the field as a means of estimating fat free mass [119], total body water, and total body fat. Bioelectrical impedance is based on the premise that when a low-level electrical current is passed through the body at a fixed frequency (50 kHz) [120], the voltage drop between two electrodes is proportional to the body's fluid volume in that region of the body. This, in turn, is used to estimate fat-free and fat masses. Bioelectrical impedance is based on the principle that lean tissue, which contains large amounts of water and electrolytes, is a good electrical conductor, and that fat, which is anhydrous, is a poor conductor. Therefore, the greater the total body water and fat free mass are, the less resistance to the flow of the electric current occurs.  \n",
      "For healthy adults, the water content of fat free mass is relatively constant: 0.732 per kg [121]. Thus, any measurement technique based on the assay for total body water indirectly provides an estimate for fat free mass. The body's percentage of fat can be defined as % fat = 100 × (weight - fat free mass of total body fat)/wt. The voltage produced between two electrodes is measured with a BIA analyzer. Most bioelectrical impedance systems include body fat software based upon descriptive models. Two commonly used bioelectrical impedance analyzers are the RJL System (Detroit, MI) and Vahalla Scientific (San Diego, CA).  \n",
      "The biolelectrical impedance measurement is a relatively simple procedure. The subject lies supine on a nonconducting surface with arms and legs abducted at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees  \n",
      "from the trunk. Source electrodes are placed at the wrist and at the ankle so that a weak alternating current undetectable by the subject can be passed through the body. The voltage drop is measured and the resistance calculated while the current is kept constant. The actual measurement procedure for the subject is relatively easy and can be performed within a few minutes. Resistance is recorded to the nearest ohm and used in prediction equations to estimate total body fat or fat free mass.  \n",
      "A major source of error for the bioelectrical impedance method is intraindividual variability in whole-body resistance due to factors that affect the subject's state of hydration. Taking resistance measures 2 to 4 h after a meal decreases resistance and is likely to overpredict fat free mass by almost 1.5 kg [122]. On the other hand, dehydration increases resistance, resulting in a 5.0-kg underestimate of fat free mass [123]. The accuracy and precision of the bioelectrical impedance measurements are also affected by instrumentation, technician skill, subject factors, and environmental factors [124]. Thus, the accuracy of bioelectrical impedance results and their interpretation should be used with caution [125]. Another concern with bioelectrical impedance is that it is an indirect method and must be calibrated with a reference assay. The number of bioelectrical impedance calibration equations that have been developed is approaching the level observed for the skinfold method.  \n",
      "In a review, Kushner [126] reported the mean CV of multiple resistance measurements taken on the same subject in the same day ranges from 0.3 to 2.8%. When measured over days or weeks, intraindividual variability ranged from 0.8 to 3.6%. Kushner and Schoeller [127] reported intraindividual variations in bioelectrical impedance measurements to average 1.3 and 2.2% for withinday and week-to-week measurements, respectively.  \n",
      "bioelectrical impedance is an attractive method of body fat assessment because it is quick, relatively inexpensive, does not require a high degree of technician skill, yields results immediately, and does not intrude on the subject's privacy. However, because the bioelectrical impedance method is based on impedance to electrical current flow, the subject's state of hydration can influence the results; thus, strict guidelines for standardizing hydration levels prior to bioelectrical impedance testing need to be followed [109].  \n",
      "Although the practical measurement of bioelectrical impedance is easy, a number of factors influence the measurements and, even after careful standardization of the measurement procedure, there remain factors for which one cannot easily control remain. One source of error is the distribution of body water between the intra- and extracellular spaces. Furthermore, body impedance depends on body and skin temperature, body posture during measurement, skin humidity (skin resistivity), and whether the subject is in the fasting state or took strenuous exercise before the measurements. For all these reasons, prediction equations for body fat based on impedance are highly population specific and are clearly different between males and females and age groups (as a result of body water distribution). Using inadequate prediction equations can lead to high bias and, in lean subjects, often results in negative values for percent body fat. Changes in body fat have been studied by bioelectrical impedance and other techniques in many publications. The results are not consistent.\n",

To measure energy balance, scientists and clinicians measure energy intake and expenditure via direct (e.g., doubly labeled water) and indirect (e.g., questionnaires and diaries) methods [128]. Assessment of energy intake and expenditure is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, Chapter 2 discusses assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity in detail.

      "It does not appear that the present epidemic of overweight and obesity will disappear in the near future. The ability to diagnose and treat obesity is limited, in part, by the ability to assess body fat. This chapter reviewed many of the existing body fat measures and their strengths and limitations (see Table 3.1). The precision and accuracy errors reported for the various measurement techniques are presented in Table 3.2. Direct, or laboratory-based, body fat methods, when performed at their best, have an error of at least 2 to 3% body fat when compared with results from other methods [131].

      "Physical activity has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer primarily because of its effects on steroid sex hormones. Physical activity also may influence breast cancer risk through its influence on energy balance, weight control, insulin sensitivity, and immune function. To date, at least 50 observational studies have been conducted to examine the association between some measure of recreational or occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. The majority of studies have observed an inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. In this chapter, we first consider the mechanisms that may account for lower breast cancer risk among physically active women and then review studies of recreational and occupational physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk. Finally, we comment on the importance of timing, frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity in determining breast cancer risk.\n",

      "Evidence exists that estrogen is critical in the development of breast cancer through increased proliferation of epithelial breast cells. In in vitro [1,2] and in vivo [3] studies, estradiol, considered the most potent and active form of estrogen, has been shown to increase mitotic activity of breast epithelial cells. By increasing mitoses, estrogens act to promote breast cell proliferation and thus increase the possibility of mutations, including those that are carcinogenic. Thus, cumulative lifetime exposure to estrogen is a key factor in determining a woman's breast cancer risk [4,5].  \n",
      "During reproductive years, particularly during adolescence, high levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity have an impact on markers of ovarian hormone exposure, resulting in delayed menarche, increased likelihood of secondary amenorrhea and irregular or anovulatory menstrual cycles, and shortened luteal phases of the menstrual cycle; thus, physical activity is associated with reduced levels of estradiol, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [6-11]. In part due to the effects of physical activity, these factors would result in a reduction in lifetime ovulatory cycles and cumulative estrogen and progesterone exposure, therefore potentially reducing risk of breast cancer. Although the majority of early studies were conducted in athletes, increasing evidence suggests ovarian function also is altered in recreational athletes through lower mean hormone levels and longer anovular menstrual cycle length [9,10,12-14].  \n",
      "After menopause, production of estrogen from the ovaries is negligible, resulting in a dramatic decrease of circulating estrogen levels compared to premenopausal women. Studies in normal weight women have shown that estrogen levels decline to approximately one-third of the lowest premenopausal levels [15]. The main endogenous source of postmenopausal estrogen production is from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone in adipose tissue. Women who are physically active during their postmenopausal years have decreased levels of serum estrone, estradiol, and androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) that are precursors to estrogens [16-19]. An association between physical activity and increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) also has been observed [20]. However, the association between the various hormones and physical activity in postmenopausal women has not been as consistent as that found for premenopausal women, and several studies have found no clear association between hormone levels [21,22] or urinary hormone metabolites [23] and physical activity.  \n",
      "Because aromatization of androstenedione to estrone takes place in fatty tissue, a larger amount of estrogen is produced by heavier postmenopausal women compared to thinner women [24]. Consequently, obesity and weight gain are well-established risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer [25-28]. High levels of physical activity have been associated with lower weight, lower BMI, and weight loss [16,20,21,29]. Thus, the effects of physical activity in postmenopausal women may be due to direct suppression of hormone levels or indirect because physical activity affects body weight.\n",

      "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I have been implicated in carcinogenesis because they play a role in stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis [30]. Increased levels of insulin specifically also may increase breast cancer risk because they have been associated with decreased levels of SHBG and, consequently, higher levels of free estradiol - that is, estradiol that is not inactivated through binding to SHBG [31]. Some epidemiological studies support a positive association between insulin levels and breast cancer risk [32,33]. High levels of insulin also are associated with decreased levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-I (IGFBP-I) that may result in a higher level of unbound IGF-I [34].  \n",
      "Insulin-like growth factor I also has been shown in vitro to act as a mitogen in breast cell lines and synergistically with estradiol to promote mitosis [35-37], and to play a role in promoting breast cell differentiation and transformation and in suppressing apoptosis [35]. Epidemiological studies have suggested that high IGF-I levels are associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer [38-40].  \n",
      "Two major determinants of insulin resistance are abdominal obesity and physical inactivity. Regular physical activity has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity and decreased levels of serum insulin, independent of its impact on body weight [20,41,42]. Therefore, it may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Previous studies support a positive relationship between obesity and IGF-I levels [42], but current evidence does not allow clear conclusions to be drawn regarding a possible association between physical activity, independent of body weight, and IGF-I levels [42,43].\n",

      "Changes in immune function may also mediate the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Some researchers have observed that physical activity heightens immune response and may reduce risk of chronic disease by increasing production of natural killer (NK) cells that contribute to immune defense [44.45]. This hypothesis is not specific to breast cancer, but would explain a protective role of physical activity in most cancers.  \n",
      "The immune response hypothesis may be particularly relevant to breast cancer because recent evidence suggests that estrogen suppresses NK cell activity [46-48]; therefore, higher levels of estrogens and suppressed NK cell activity may interact to increase breast cancer risk in inactive women. Consequently, women who are physically active may be at a decreased risk of breast cancer because they have a higher production of NK cells as well as lower levels of estrogen. However, little work specifically has been done to define the role of immune function in breast carcinogenesis, particularly the potential mediation between immune function and hormones.\n",

      "Maintenance of normal body weight throughout a woman's adult years is one of the few known modifiable risk factors for breast cancer that occurs after the menopause. Increased physical activity has been consistently associated with lower body mass index (BMI kg/m²) and weight maintenance. Weight maintenance is achieved through energy balance in which energy intake equals energy expenditure, resulting in no net change of stored energy in the body. High energy intake coupled with low expenditure leads to excess storage of adipose tissue and results in obesity [49]. As previously stated, excess adiposity (high BMI) and the accumulation of adipose tissue over time (weight gain) are associated with increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women [25-28]. In addition to influencing estrogen production directly, the lack of energy balance resulting in excess adipose tissue is associated with many other potential breast cancer risk factors, such as:  \n",
      "- Insulin resistance [50,51]\n",
      "- . Increased levels of IGF-I [51]\n",
      "- Increased levels of aromatase activity, resulting in increased total estradiol [52] ●\n",
      "- Decreased levels of SHBG, resulting in increased levels of free estradiol [20,52]\n",
      "- o Immunosuppression [53]  \n",
      "Therefore, promotion of normal weight maintenance through energy balance, increased physical activity, and reduced caloric intake may be an effective approach to reducing the risk of breast cancer [54,55].\n",

      "To date, 16 prospective cohorts [56–71], 22 population-based case-control studies [72–93], and four hospital-based case-control studies [94-97] have examined the relationship between recreational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Seven studies yielded more than one publication [62.67.70,82,85,88.97-107]; consequently, only the most recent report from each study has been used to reference each study. Additionally, a study by Enger et al. [108] combined and analyzed subjects from two different previously cited studies [72.106] and therefore was not considered as a separate study population.  \n",
      "Overall, most studies suggest that physically active women have a lower risk of developing breast cancer than physically inactive women. A 20 to 80% reduction in risk with physical activity has been reported in 12 cohort studies [57–62,64,65,67–69,71]; 16 population-based case control studies [72-74,78-86,88,90,91,93] observed a reduction in risk ranging from 20 to 70% and three hospital-based case control studies [95-97] generally reported a 20 to 30% reduction in risk (Table 4.1).  \n",
      "The association between physical activity and breast cancer also is consistent across different populations and countries. Studies conducted in Australia [73], various countries across Europe [58,80,81,95,96], Asia [78,84,97], and the U.S. and Canada [57,59-62,65,67,69,71,72,74,79, 82,83,85,86,88,90,91,93] have reported an inverse relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Within U.S. studies, associations between physical activity and breast cancer were observed in multiethnic populations as well as specific subpopulations of white [57,59,69,86], black [83], Hispanic [86], and Asian-American women [93].  \n",
      "In some studies, the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk also has been assessed separately for in situ and invasive breast cancer as well as estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive and negative tumors. Although many previous studies include in situ and invasive breast cancer cases, only one study specifically examined the association between in situ breast carcinoma and exercise activity [91]. In one additional study, researchers examined the association between physical activity and breast cancer stratified by stage of disease and found risk reduction to be greater for localized invasive disease compared to in situ or regional/distant breast cancer [69]. Two studies also reported risk ratios separately for ER/PR positive and negative tumors, but neither found a difference in risk by ER/PR subtype [65,108].  \n",
      "The impact of physical activity on age at breast cancer onset also has been examined in some previous studies [57,109]. Physical activity, particularly in adolescence, was associated with significantly delayed onset of breast cancer in a case-only analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers [109]. In the Adventist Health Study, Fraser et al. observed age of onset for breast cancer was approximately 6.6 years earlier for women who were inactive at baseline compared to active women [57].\n",

      "Questions regarding physical activity range from general questions such as \"Do you get much exercise in things you do for recreation?\" (NHANES-I questionnaire) [67] to very detailed reconstructed histories used in some case-control studies; these are based on lifetime calendars collecting information on duration, frequency, and intensity of physical activity that allow researchers to build exposure measures for different time periods throughout a woman's lifetime [72,85,88,91]. Some studies also collected information on frequency of various activities, but lacked individual information on duration and/or intensity [61.69,102]. In two other studies, physical activity was indirectly inferred through study design comparing athletes vs. nonathletes [62], or physical education teachers to language teachers [110]. Some questionnaires only allowed for a limited number of activities to be reported for each time period [84.94], so activity histories in these studies may have underestimated the actual activity level of extremely active women.  \n",
      "Summarv measures based on the available information from questionnaire data were then used to compare women with higher levels of physical activity to those with lower levels or who were inactive. In some instances, the level of detail was minimal; women were classified only as having little, moderate, or much activity [67,96]. Other studies have collected the type of activity and hours per week of activity. In these studies, researchers have been able to examine activity level based on an intensity score, the metabolic equivalents of energy expended per hour of each individual activity (MET) [60.65.69.74.75.77.82.84–86.106]. However, these MET values are assigned to every individual participating in an activity and do not consider individual variation in the intensity of the activity, a function of skill and effort. In general, the MET values used are derived from the Compendium of Physical Activities [111] and this method of deriving MET-hours may result in misclassification of true energy expenditure.  \n",

      "Despite the variety of questionnaire approaches, the range of detail obtained, and the paucity of information on intensity of physical activities collected, most epidemiological studies have observed an inverse association between recreational physical activity and breast cancer risk. However, the amount of physical activity needed to lower breast cancer risk by a certain percentage remains unclear.  \n",
      "The hypothesized biological mechanisms mediating an association between physical activity and breast cancer are based on observed physiological effects of moderate to vigorous exercise. However, no information is available regarding the direct physiological response to less intense activities. The effect of low-intensity activity (such as household activities, gardening, dancing, leisurely walking, or other activities with a MET score below 4) is still unclear, but may be of importance - particularly for postmenopausal breast cancer - because a large portion of activity among postmenopausal and elderly women is not vigorous [112].  \n",
      "Although previous studies have examined the association between leisure physical activity, such as walking, biking, swimming, and aerobics, not all studies have included the effects of other low-intensity activities, such as gardening, housework, or shopping, in their calculation of leisure physical activity; this may lead to an underestimation of true energy expenditure. A study examining the effect of retirement on leisure physical activity levels showed levels of recreational activity, including walking and household or gardening activity increased after retirement regardless of individuals' physical activity while they were working adults [112]. Therefore, in studies of postmenopausal breast cancer, especially those including some retired persons, inclusion of activities such as gardening or other housework may be important when calculating leisure activity levels.  \n",
      "Not only does the existing literature differ in the methods used to collect physical activity information, but studies also differ dramatically in the time frame of exposure. The time period of activity during a woman's life that is most important for predicting her breast cancer risk is still unclear because estrogen levels throughout a woman's life are key determinants of breast cancer risk among pre- and postmenopausal women. Lifetime recreational physical activity recording activity for every year of life [72,85,88,91], adolescent physical activity [62,64,71,72,79,82,84], and recent or baseline physical activity [57-61,64,65,69,71,74,84,86,88,97] have been associated with lower breast cancer risk. Studies examining risk more broadly for specific decades of life (asking a woman about activity in her teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, etc.) also have observed an inverse association with specific or all examined time periods [82,95,96].  \n",
      "Furthermore, studies have shown that even physical activity initiated after menopause can be beneficial in reducing breast cancer risk [59,69,71]. Women who are active as adolescents and young adults are generally more likely to engage in exercise activities later in life than women who were never active [113]; thus, it has been an epidemiological challenge to examine risk in women who are only active at one point in time. Therefore, even though it appears that physical activity at various points during a woman's lifetime (although affecting hormones and other potential mechanisms differently) may reduce risk of breast cancer, the important time periods for predicting risk remain unclear.  \n",
      "Epidemiological studies are also limited in their ability to measure lifetime or past physical activity without potential bias or misclassification of that past exposure because studies depend on the participant's ability to recall past activity accurately. Studies assessing the reliability of longterm recall of physical activity have shown that agreement between baseline and recalled activity was generally about 75% [114,115]. Participant characteristics, such as age, race, education, body weight, and marital status, have been shown to have little association with quality of recall of past physical activity [116]. The likelihood of recall bias has been minimized in many studies that have used validated lifetime calendars to aid study participants in recalling physical activity throughout their lifetime [72,85,88,91]. In cohort studies, the inability to recall past activity levels accurately would most likely be nondifferential, biasing risk estimates toward the null value; however, few cohort studies have attempted to obtain any historical information regarding physical activity [69–71].\n",

      "Document 116:\n",
      "Twenty-one observational studies have examined the relationship between occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Two studies yielded more than one publication [110,117–120]; consequently, only the most recent report from each study has been included in Table 4.1. An association of sedentary occupations with increased risk of breast cancer has been documented in reports from three [58,64,110] of five [58,64,68,110.121] prospective cohort studies. Published reports from six [80,84,90,104,120,122] of eleven [78,80,81,84,89,90,92,93,104.120,122] population-based case-control studies and three [96.123,124] of four [96.123-125] hospital-based casecontrol studies also document an inverse association between occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk. Finally, one retrospective cohort study [126] documented an inverse association between high levels of occupational activity and breast cancer risk (Table 4.1).  \n",
      "Levels of occupational physical activity have been estimated indirectly by converting iob titles using a predetermined coding schema such as the U.S. Department of Labor occupational activity codes [122,126] or by self-reported level of occupational physical activity (sedentary, light, moderate, heavy lifting) [58,68,96,121]. Generally, results across these studies have been consistent despite the different approaches for assigning intensity levels for the occupational activities.  \n",
      "Ten previous studies calculated a quasi-lifetime occupational physical activity score based on report of \"usual lifetime\" or \"longest held\" occupation [58,68,78,80,81,110,120,121,125,126] and eleven studies calculated occupational physical activity based on study participants reporting multiple or all jobs held throughout their lifetime [64.84.89. 90.92.93.96.104.122–124]. Studies using a composite measure of lifetime physical activity based on the reporting of multiple or all jobs held more often observed an inverse association with breast cancer risk [64.84.90, 96,104,110,122,123] than did studies that utilized usual lifetime occupation [58,80,120,126]. Using \"usual occupation\" to define lifetime occupational physical activity likely misclassifies and underestimates true lifetime activity levels, thus leading to a potential bias in risk estimates.\n",

      "Few risk factors for breast cancer are likely to be true confounders of the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer. Moreover, lifetime or historical measures of physical activity are likely to be unaffected by adjustment for recent diet, BMI, or other baseline factors because these factors are not generally related to activity at earlier time points. In studies of recent recreational physical activity, adjustment for potential confounding factors has not had a large impact on risk estimates [61,69,70,86].  \n",
      "The most commonly hypothesized confounder of the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk is obesity; with the exception of a few studies [56.64,74,79,84], all studies of recreational physical activity adjusted for obesity using BMI. Most studies of recreational physical activity also have adjusted for other potential confounders, such as age, parity, family history, energy intake, menopausal hormone use, and alcohol intake. Studies of occupational physical activity were least likely to consider potential confounding factors [68,121,122,125-127]. However, the association between physical activity and breast cancer has not been greatly attenuated by adjustment for potential confounding factors.  \n",
      "Potential effect modification by various factors has been assessed in some previous studies. One may speculate that the influence of moderate levels of physical activity on hormone levels in women with a favorable estrogen profile (i.e., lower baseline levels of hormones) may be sufficient to reduce risk. Women with higher levels of baseline circulating estrogens, such as women with a positive family history of breast cancer, current menopausal hormone users, or obese women, may not experience a reduction in risk with moderate physical activity. Women with higher baseline estrogen levels may require more vigorous and frequent activity to substantiate a reduction in risk.  \n",
      "Results from two studies suggest that the association with physical activity may be stronger in women without a family history of breast cancer [88,91]. Two previous studies also report a greater reduction in risk with increasing physical activity among parous women compared to nulliparous women [72,101]; however, two other studies documented the opposite finding, with risk reduction greater in nulliparous women [81,105]. In four previous studies [63,69,77,85], researchers examined potential effect modification by menopausal hormone use, and one study suggests that physical activity may be more strongly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer in nonusers of menopausal hormones [69]. In four previous studies, researchers examined effect modification by adult weight gain [61,64,82,106]; one study reported a greater reduction in risk among women who had less than a 17% increase in weight [106].  \n",
      "Some studies documented a greater reduction in risk among leaner women compared to heavier women [58,71,81,88]. In addition to the potential role of obesity as a confounder or effect modifier, there is the possibility that obesity may be on the causal pathway between physical activity and primarily postmenopausal breast cancer development. For example, physical activity around the time of menopause may reduce postmenopausal obesity and may subsequently prevent the initiation of malignant transformation of breast cells [128]. However, most studies of physical activity and breast cancer adjusted for BMI, and an inverse association persisted; additionally, physical activity may have direct effects on circulating hormone levels independent of the impact on BMI. Thus, it is unlikely that the observed inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk is entirely explained by BMI. Differentiating among effects of confounding, effect modification, and factors in the causal pathway is an ongoing epidemiological challenge in examining the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk.  \n",
      "Discrepancies in study results may be due to underlying differences in study population characteristics, a lack of sufficient statistical power to detect a true difference between subgroups, or chance. It should also be noted that the study publications reporting no effect modification have not provided details of analyses; therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether the failure to observe significant effect modification is due to a lack of sufficient statistical power.\n",

      "In summary, most previous observational studies observe an inverse association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. Risk appears to be reduced among women reporting physical activity at various points throughout their lifetime. The specific amount of physical activity necessary to infer a reduction in risk is not fully understood, but many previous studies suggest that 3 to 4 or more hours per week may be necessary to see an impact on breast cancer risk. Although the exact frequency, duration, and intensity are not well established, there is sufficient evidence that promotion of physical activity is an important modifiable factor for breast cancer risk.\n",

      "Approximately 130,000 new cases and 55,000 deaths are attributed to colorectal cancer yearly in the U.S [1]. Worldwide, approximately 8.5% of all incident cancers are colorectal cancers [2]. A 20-fold variation in reported incidence of colorectal cancer has been noted around the world: developed countries have high incidence rates and developing countries have much lower incidence rates [2]. Furthermore, migrant populations who move from countries of low to high incidence of colon cancer adopt the rates of the host country after migration, suggesting the importance of diet and lifestyle factors in colon cancer etiology [3]. Physical inactivity is gaining in recognition as one of the lifestyle factors that may importantly contribute to the development of colon cancer.\n",

      "Physical activity has many dimensions, including frequency, intensity, and time. Each of these dimensions can be linked to activity performed at work, during recreation, or around the house. The amount of and intensity with which activities are performed may influence what is being measured in physical activity. The time period during one's life when activity levels are measured may have a further impact on associations.  \n",
      "Early studies examining the association between physical activity and colon cancer focused on work-related activity [4,5], comparing those who were most active on the job to those who had lower levels of activity or who were sedentary. As the population transcended from one in which activity on the job was the norm to one in which it was the exception, questionnaires capturing self-reported physical activity became the primary mode of collecting physical activity data. These questionnaires usually differ in their focus on activities done at leisure, work, around the home, or pertaining to care of children and other adults - as well as in their ability to assess duration, frequency, and intensity of activities performed [6-9]. Some questionnaires have gathered detailed  \n",
      "information about various types of activity. Others have used more general questions, asking about limited activities and sometimes ignoring intensity of activities performed, and at other times neglecting to determine time involved in specific activities [9-11].  \n",
      "In almost all instances, information on the benefits of continuous vs. cumulative activity and the number of days per week on which activities need to be performed to maximize protective associations have been lacking. The underlying biological mechanisms involved in the disease process and ability of questionnaires to capture these mechanisms may differ and thus influence investigator ability to detect associations with colon and rectal cancer.  \n",
      "In addition to issues surrounding questionnaire design is the ability of study participants to recall activities performed accurately and to assign intensity levels to activities performed that are consistent with how others view and assign their activity levels [9,11,12]. Attempts to test reliability and validity of physical activity data are limited, although activities performed at a more vigorous level of effort appear to be reported more consistently over time than activities performed at moderate levels of effort [12]. It is possible that people who perform the same activities on a regular basis may be more likely to recall their activities than those who do many different activities less frequently.  \n",
      "Associations between colorectal cancer and physical activity have been evaluated by metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) per week; energy expended per week; time spent in activity per week; and ranking individuals based on physical activity index scores that take all available activity data into account. Direct comparison of association between studies using the same measure of physical activity is not possible because of differences in methods used to assess and analyze physical activity. Despite this, associations between colon cancer and physical activity are remarkably consistent.\n",

      "Site-specific associations within the colorectal area have been examined, including tumors in the proximal, distal, and rectal areas. Anatomic definitions of colorectal cancer tumor sites that are often used include: proximal (cecum through transverse colon); distal (splenic flexure, descending. and sigmoid colon); and rectal (rectosigmoid junction and rectum). Differences in association by tumor site can stem from different study designs used to study associations; limited power to estimate associations when evaluating smaller subsets of data; or etiological differences in associations.  \n",
      "Although many studies of colon cancer and physical activity have been conducted, fewer studies have examined all tumor sites. Thus, studies generally focus on colon cancer or rectal cancer, although some studies have attempted to estimate associations between physical activity and colon and rectal cancer. In a review of the literature (Table 5.2), studies have been included that have at least 100 cases of colorectal cancer and have used questionnaires that have at least three physical activity questions. Tables are organized by date of start of data collection rather than date of publication. This was done to provide a historical reference to data collection methods.\n",

      "Associations between colon cancer and physical activity have been consistent for men and women, for different study designs, and for people living in different parts of the world. Several reviews have outlined many of these studies in detail [13-15]. In a review published in 2002 [13], the inverse association was documented in 43 of 51 studies that had evaluated the association. More rigorous studies have focused on total activity, leisure time activity, intensity of activity, and, in some instances, lifetime or long-term activity [13,16-18]. Although a shift in the activity variable studied to describe the association over time has been observed, this shift most probably reflects changes in major sources of activity in the population as well as the need to better understand multiple dimensions of the physical activity and colon cancer relationship.  \n",
      "Potential confounding, a bias that can distort the true association between physical activity and colon and rectal cancer, has been addressed by adjusting for a variety of factors in various studies. Confounding may be an issue because physically active people are thought to have healthier lifestyles and, possibly, lower rates of colorectal cancer. Some studies (often occupational studies using census data) have adjusted only for age; however, others have adjusted for a variety of factors, including body size, diet, screening history, family history, smoking, alcohol use, and use of aspirin — all factors associated with colon and/or rectal cancer — and also may be associated with physical activity. However, studies that have adjusted for other components of a healthy lifestyle, such as not smoking cigarettes, eating a low-risk diet, and using aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, still observe the inverse association observed in other studies in which not all of these factors have been taken into account [16,18-22].  \n",
      "Many early studies included cases of colon cancer as early as the 1950s and examined occupational activities, often comparing disease rates among individuals in agricultural or more physically active jobs to those of professionals or people who were more sedentary (Table 5.1). These early studies almost uniformly demonstrated reduced risk of colon cancer. Early studies included little information on leisure activity, often because occupational data were from census records and information on activities performed at leisure was generally lacking. Associations between colon cancer and nonoccupational activity, as well as occupational activity, were reported by Slattery and colleagues in 1988 [23]. This study was one of the first to report nonwork-related activities and to evaluate the impact of intensity of exercise on colon cancer risk. In this case-control study, participants were asked to report the number of hours spent in light, moderate, and intense activity for the 2 years prior to diagnosis or interview. Total physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer (OR 0.7 95% CI 0.4 to 1.3 for men and 0.5 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9 for women). Associations were strongest for intense activities among men (OR 0.3 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7).  \n",
      "This study was one of the first to have the capability to adjust for other diet and lifestyle factors that could confound associations; associations remained after adjustment for dietary factors such as energy intake, protein, fiber, and fat. Also in 1988, Gerhardsson [24] showed the beneficial effects of leisure-time activity and that total activity had a greater influence on risk than source of activity. In 1989, Severson [25] also examined total activity and vigorous types of activities in conjunction with colon cancer in a cohort followed between 1965 and 1986; all indicators of activity were associated with reduced risk.  \n",
      "Since these early studies, multiple studies have replicated these early results; most studies have shown approximately a 30 to 40% reduction in risk among the most active relative to those who are sedentary [16,19,20,24-36]. Although the magnitude of the association has remained stable over time, the indicator of activity that is most importantly associated with colon cancer has varied. This change in indicator of activity associated with risk mirrors changes in activity patterns in the populations studied.  \n",
      "Most studies have examined activity performed as an adult to assess associations; to evaluate temporal associations, the referent period is often the year or two prior to diagnosis of cases in case-control studies [16,18,19,23,26,27,29,35,37,38]. In cohort studies, data often are collected at the baseline examination obtaining information near that time. Although some studies monitor changes in activities within the cohort, others depend on the baseline examination as the exposure and do not capture activity changes that may be associated with disease occurrence 12 to 15 years later. One study of activity performed during early adulthood did not find an association between physical activity and colon cancer [34]. In Italy, the effects of physical activity performed at various ages was examined and showed the importance of activity performed at all ages, although the greatest protective effect came from occupational activity reported before age 50 [39].  \n",
      "Long-term involvement in physical activity is an important discriminator of colon cancer risk [17,18] and, in some studies, the best indicator of risk [16,18,40]. This may imply that benefits come from long-term involvement in activity, although it is possible that those involved in physical activity throughout their life more accurately report their activity levels; therefore, estimates of association are less influenced by recall bias.  \n",

      "Associations between physical activity and rectal cancer are much less consistent than those observed for colon cancer. Difference in associations could be the result of many factors, including  \n",
      "- . Different methods used to collect physical activity data\n",
      "- . Power to detect significant associations\n",
      "- o Uncontrolled confounding because many studies of rectal cancer have examined occupational exposures\n",
      "- o Differences in actual mechanisms whereby physical activity works, making detection of associations more dependent on method used to ascertain physical activity  \n",
      "As shown in Table 5.2, eight studies report only occupational data and eight report associations from leisure activities, as well as occupational activities; two report associations only from nonworkrelated activities. Of these studies, four show significantly reduced risk of rectal cancer associated with occupational activity; four show stronger associations with leisure or total activity than with occupational activity and three show reductions in risk of a similar magnitude as observed for colon cancer but with limited power to detect associations. A study of occupational activity in Italy showed protective effects for all sites within the colon, including a protective effect for tumors in the rectosigmoid junction, usually included as part of rectum, but not the rectum [39]. In that study of occupational activity by Tavini and colleagues, there was little variability in activity; most people were in the upper category of physical activity.  \n",
      "Perhaps most informative are studies that have assessed associations with nonwork-related activity as well as work-related activity and long-term activity patterns as they relate to rectal cancer. The study by Le Marchand and colleagues in Hawaii showed effects for rectal cancer similar to, although slightly stronger than, the protective effects from lifetime recreational activity for colon cancer [16]. One study of over 950 rectal cancer cases that used the same methods previously used in a large multicenter colon cancer study showed that the magmitude of risk reduction for rectal tumors was the same as that previously reported for colon tumors [41]. As in the companion study of colon cancer [18], the association remained after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Reduced risk was seen, for men and women, for activities performed at a vigorous level of effort among individuals who performed intense activity over a long period of their lives. However, another large case-control study of 1447 incident rectal cancer cases and 3106 controls did not detect a significantly reduced risk of rectal cancer from high levels of recreational activity (OR 0.88 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20) [42].\n",

      "Energy balance has been proposed as a key mechanism through which physical activity exerts its protective effect on colon cancer because energy expenditure, along with energy intake, is a key element in determining ability to maintain energy balance [43,44]. Studies show that physical activity is associated with lower levels of obesity and abdominal obesity specifically [45–48]. Effect modification or interaction, showing differences in association by different groups within the population, is one means whereby epidemiology can obtain insight into biological mechanisms. Evaluation of the interaction between physical activity and components of energy balance, such as energy intake and obesity, has been done to gain insight into the role of energy balance and how physical activity may modulate colon cancer risk through this mechanism. Studies have shown that people at greatest risk of colon cancer are sedentary with a large BMI and that the risk is greater than would be expected from each factor independently [16,49]. Similar associations have not been  \n",
      "observed for rectal cancer [50]. Given the role of physical activity in modifying the harmful effects of obesity on colon cancer risk, physical activity may become even more important as the prevalence of obesity increases.  \n",
      "It has been proposed that the influence of energy balance on risk of colon cancer may work through endogenous hormone metabolism [51]. Of particular interest is how energy balance, in general, and physical activity, specifically, relate to insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF) [51,52]. It has been proposed that insulin and IGF may play a central role in development and promotion of colon cancers [53-55]. Several studies have now shown that high levels of IGF-1 increase risk of colorectal cancer and that high levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) are associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer [56,57].  \n",
      "In another study, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 increased risk of colorectal cancer, but IGFBP-1 was associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer; however, estimates of association were imprecise in that study [56]. Studies have shown that high levels of physical activity are associated with increased insulin sensitivity, down-regulation of IGF-1, and up-relation of IGFBP-3 [58,59]; the exact intensity of the activity at which this down-regulation occurs is not clear. Epidemiological studies also suggest interaction between physical activity and glycemic load, a dietary factor thought to be associated with insulin [60].  \n",
      "Genetic factors that have been proposed as being involved in an insulin-related pathway include insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRSI), and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) [61]. Polymorphisms of these genes have been identified; some of these have been shown to have effects on insulin resistance and/or diabetes. High serum IGF-1 levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and variation in serum IGF-1 levels has been associated with a CA repeat polymorphism 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site [62]. High levels of IGFBP-3 have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer [57]. An A/C polymorphism at nucleotide -202 is associated with different levels of IGFBP3 in a dose-response fashion, i.e., AA > AC > CC.  \n",
      "The AC or CC genotypes would thus be predicted to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A Gly972Arg (G972R) polymorphism in the IRSI gene has been associated with insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes; it might be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The G1057D IRS2 polymorphism has been associated with obesity and is therefore a plausible link to insulin resistance and colorectal cancer [63].  \n",
      "Evaluation of physical activity with these genes has shown a significant interaction between physical activity and IGF1 genotype for colon cancer, a borderline (p = 0.06) interaction between IRS2 and physical activity level and risk of colon cancer. Those who were most physically active with the IGF1 1921192 genotype were at a significantly lower risk of colon cancer than those without this genotype. Low physical activity and high BMI appeared to have the greatest impact on risk in the presence of the IGFBP3 A allele (p for interaction = 0.01) [64].  \n",
      "The vitamin D receptor (VDR)4 is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation and metabolic homeostasis [65]. Some studies suggest that VDR also may be involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factormediated disease pathways [66-68]; others suggest that it may be important as a bile acid receptor. Examination of the Fokl VDR polymorphism showed that those who were least physically active were at greater risk of colon cancer if they had the ff VDR genotype (OR 3.46 95% C1 1.58 to 7.58; p interaction 0.05) [69].\n",

      "Given the associations between physical activity and colon, and possibly rectal cancer, it is possible that several biological mechanisms are involved. Given the lack of association between BMI and rectal cancer and inconsistent association between physical activity and rectal cancer, it is likely that mechanisms other than energy balance are operational - if, indeed, the association between physical activity and rectal cancer is real. Findings from controlled experimental studies generate most of the support for various proposed mechanisms, although assessment of interaction in epidemiological studies can provide clues to important mechanisms.  \n",
      "The effect of physical activity on gastrointestinal transit time was the hypothesized mechanism put forth when the initial observation that physical activity decreased risk of colon cancer was made [70]. It has been shown that people involved in moderate-level activities, such as walking, have a decreased gastrointestinal (GI) transit time, resulting in increased propulsion of colonic contents through the colon [71]; some studies suggest that more vigorous activity is needed for stimulation of the vagus nerve responsible for increased propulsion [72,73]. Physical activity also is associated with reduced time that bile acids and other carcinogens are in contact with the GI tract. An interaction between colon cancer and fiber suggests that transit time may be an important mechanism [21,74].  \n",
      "Physical activity has been shown to influence immune response [73,74]. Natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages are important components of the immune system [75]. Physical exercise is known to influence the activity of these cells consistently, with a twofold increase in their circulation immediately following intense activity [78]. Regular exercise training has been shown to enhance the resting level of NK cell activity [79]. Exercise also has been shown to influence levels of cytokines, soluble immune mediators produced by various immune cells. Interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interlukin-6 are major cytokines that have been shown to vary by amount and intensity of physical activity performed in healthy individuals [76].  \n",
      "Prostaglandins have been associated with tumor growth in studies of animals [80]. Prostaglandin F, alpha inhibits tumor growth in the colon and increases gut motility; prostaglandin E, decreases colonic motility and increases the rate of colonic cell proliferation, especially in cancer cells [8] 82]. Strenuous physical activity appears to increase levels of prostaglandin F, alpha and inhibit synthesis of prostaglandin E2 [80,82]. Studies have shown that high activity was inversely associated with rectal mucosal prostaglandin E2 [83].\n",

      "Mutations in colorectal tissue are acquired over time, ultimately leading to a tumor. Although data are limited, evaluation of physical activity with other types of mutations in colon tumors can provide clues about specific disease pathways and how physical activity relates to these factors. For colon cancer, in one study, mutations p53, Ki-ras, and microsatellite instability (MSI) have been examined with physical activity. Results suggest that p53 and Ki-ras mutations may be associated with physical activity [83,84]. It appears that physical activity may be related to p53 mutations through its association with a Western diet [83]; for Ki-ras mutations, the importance of physical activity may be through its modifying effect on body weight [84]. One study has examined physical activity with colorectal adenomas and has reported that more active people were more likely to have Kiras-negative than Ki-ras-positive tumors [85].\n",

      "Given the consistent association between physical activity and colon cancer, being physically active to reduce risk of colon, and possibly rectal, cancer is an agent of cancer prevention. In order to implement activity as a chemoprevention agent, it is important to understand how much activity is necessary, how often it should be undertaken, and how intense the activity should be to reduce risk. Most studies have not collected physical activity information that readily answers these important questions. The dose, or amount of activity needed, is often lacking, although estimates of dose can be made through examination of intensity and time, which are indicators of dose needed for protection. Dose-response has been reviewed in detail [15] and is summarized here.  \n",
      "Intensity of activity performed is one indicator of dose-response. More recent studies that have examined activities by intensity often show greater protection than moderate activity or total activity [16,18,19,26,33-35,86,87]. Some studies report protective effects for moderate/vigorous activities, making it difficult to determine the independent effects of each. In a study by Slattery et al. [41], activities performed at a moderate and a vigorous level of intensity were associated with reduced risk of rectal cancer. To determine the impact of exercise intensity on risk, data were modeled to evaluate the effects of moderate and vigorous levels of intensity on colon and rectal cancer risk simultaneously. Results showed that vigorous activity remained significantly protective and that the association with moderate activity disappeared after adjustment for vigorous activity.  \n",
      "The amount of time (in terms of frequency, duration, and whether time spent should be cumulative) needed to reduce colon cancer risk is still debated. Because studies report associations differently, it is difficult to determine the amount of activity associated with reduced risk of colon or rectal cancer for some studies show significant protective effects at the upper tertile or quintile of activity and others have examined physical activity indices. Some report in MET minutes needed and others in hours of activity performed.  \n",
      "Crude estimates of frequency and duration associated with reduced risk are shown in Table 5.3. These results focus on recreational or nonwork-related activity because that activity can be altered to reduce risk; however, work activity may add to the overall activity needed or explain some of the variation in risk observed between studies. Of importance is the observation that less intense activity requires a greater amount of time to see the same protective effect observed for intense activity at less time. This is illustrated in the study by Whittemore and colleagues [27] in which the same level of risk reduction is assigned for 1 h of vigorous activity per day or 5 h of moderate activity per day.  \n",
      "Similarly, in the studies by Martinez and Giovannucci [19,36], calculation of MET hours per week included activities performed at a moderate to vigorous level of intensity. Activities are given an amount of time corresponding to MET h/week. For instance, running for 1 h is equivalent to roughly 10.2 MET h; playing tennis for 1 h is equivalent to roughly 6 MET h, and 1 h of walking at a moderate to brisk pace is roughly equivalent to 3.2 MET h. Again, these show that the duration during which activities should be performed depends on the intensity of the activity. For instance, for running, 2 to 4 h per week of vigorous activity would be needed to see a protective effect and, if walking at a moderate to brisk pace, 7 to 14 h of activity per week may be needed.  \n",
      "Taken together, recommendations based on studies in which data are available suggest that risk reduction occurs from performing somewhere around 3.5 to 4 h of vigorous activity per week; however, for moderate activity, 7 to 35 h of activity would be needed for the same risk reduction. The combination of intensity, duration, and frequency is a key element to the risk equation and therefore to any public health recommendation based on epidemiological data. A recommendation of about 3.5 to 4 h of vigorous activity per week, which translate to about 35 min of vigorous activity every day or 45 min of vigorous activity 5 days a week, may therefore be required to see a protective effect from physical activity on colon cancer risk.\n",

      "From existing data, it appears that sedentary people have a 60% to twofold increased risk of developing colon cancer; some evidence suggests similar associations for rectal cancer. Comparing physical inactivity to other risk factors for colon cancer, it has been have estimated that 13 to 14% of colon cancer in the population could be attributed to physical inactivity [18,88], which is comparable to estimates of 12% of colon cancer cases attributed to not using aspirin or NSAIDs and 12% of colon cancer cases attributed to eating a Western dietary pattern.  \n",

      "Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates vary around the world with the highest rates observed in the U.S., Canada, and Scandinavia, and the lowest rates found in China and other Asian countries [1,2]. These differences are attributable to variability in genetic susceptibility, exposure to external risk factors, and health care and cancer registrations [2]. The incidence of prostate cancer increased rapidly in North America over the last 20 years; this was mainly attributable to the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests to screen for this disease, but has recently returned to levels observed prior to the introduction of PSA testing [3,4]. Currently, prostate cancer incidence is the most common malignancy in men in the U.S. and Canada and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death among men [3,4].  \n",
      "Prostate cancer etiology is still relatively poorly understood, with only a few established and several postulated risk factors [2,5,6]. The main established risk factors are age, race [7], and family history [6,8,9]; possible risk factors include endogenous hormones [10,11], dietary intake [12–16], obesity [17], smoking [18,19], alcohol consumption [20-22], history of sexually transmitted diseases [23,24], vasectomy [25], and occupational exposures including cadmium, zinc, and pesticides [26,27]. There is inconsistent epidemiological evidence for these postulated risk factors.  \n",
      "Primary prevention strategies for prostate cancer include possible chemoprevention approaches with micronutrients (e.g., vitamins C and E, selenium, lycopene) [28-32] because some epidemiological evidence suggests that prostate cancer risk is decreased with these dietary antioxidants. Other agents have also been proposed for pharmaceutical development, including inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activity, because these two pathways may be involved in prostate carcinogenesis [33]. Several large-scale prostate chemoprevention trials on selenium, vitamin E, and the 5-0 -reductase inhibitor, finasteride, are currently ongoing (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention [SELECT] Trial) [34] or have recently been completed (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [PCPT]) [35]. The PCPT trial demonstrated a 25% reduction in prostate cancer incidence among men taking finasteride in comparison to men in the placebo group. However, important adverse side effects occurred among men in the intervention group, including an increased risk for high-grade disease; thus, the efficacy of this agent for prostate cancer chemoprevention remains uncertain.  \n",
      "Another modifiable lifestyle risk factor for prostate cancer that is receiving research attention is physical activity. Physical activity is an important means for the primary prevention of numerous chronic diseases, including cancers of the colon and the breast [36], and could potentially be an alternative to chemoprevention strategies for prostate cancer. The purpose of this chapter is to review the epidemiological studies on physical activity and prostate cancer risk, as well as to discuss the main biological mechanisms that may be involved in this putative association, the methodological issues that need to be considered for investigations on this topic, and future research directions in this area.\n",

      "Document 133:\n",
      "A systematic review of the published literature through May, 2004, was conducted to identify all animal experimental and epidemiological studies that reported a measure of physical activity in relation to prostate cancer. To be included in this review, the studies needed to be examining physical activity as an etiological risk factor. No restrictions were made by language or year of publication. When multiple reports from the same study were found, the most recent and/or complete publication was chosen for inclusion into the review. The studies were categorized by type of study design and type of data collection methods and then reviewed systematically for the strength, consistency, dose-response, and coherence of the relation between physical activity and prostate cancer risk. The biological plausibility of this putative relation was examined separately by reviewing the literature on endogenous sex and metabolic hormone levels, immune function, and body size and prostate cancer risk. Methodological limitations with these studies were identified and considered as possible explanations for the differences observed across studies.\n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Document 134:\n",
      "A total of 38 publications of epidemiological studies and no animal experimental studies were identified that examined some aspect of the possible association between physical activity and prostate cancer risk [37-74]. Of these 38 publications, there were multiple publications from the same study. The prospective cohort study of Harvard and University of Pennsylvania students was first presented by Whittemore et al. in 1985 [38] and then updated in five subsequent publications by Paffenbarger and Lee [39,43-45,59]; only the most recent publication from this cohort is included in this review [59]. One of these updates was the paper by Paffenbarger et al. [39], which also includes two analyses from a cohort of longshoremen and is presented in this review.  \n",
      "Likewise, two papers describe follow-ups of different lengths of time of the cohort from the National Health and Nutrition and Examination I Survey [42,48]. Only the second publication by Steenland et al. [48] will be included. An additional analysis on energy intake and prostate cancer from the Male Health Professionals Cohort Study, originally published by Giovannucci et al. [53], was published recently by Platz et al. [62]. Because this most recent analysis [62] only examined interactions of body size and physical activity, rather than the association of physical activity and prostate cancer risk, it is not included in this review. Finally, the paper by Ilic et al. [49] was excluded because of the lack of information on the methods used in the study, including the physical activity assessment and the analytic approach. Thus, a total of 19 cohort studies [37,39,40,41,46-48,50-61] and 12 case-control studies [63-74] could be reviewed. Of the 19 cohort studies, 3 had prostate cancer mortality, rather than incidence, as the endpoint [37,39,40]. Thus far, no studies have examined the association between physical activity and prostate cancer survival. One study [50] has examined the association between physical fitness, in addition to the association with physical activity, and prostate cancer incidence and is included in this review.\n",

      "The studies that are included here cover those conducted in different countries worldwide using wide ranging study populations, designs, endpoints, and methods for assessing physical activity and its association with prostate cancer risk (Table 6.2). Given the heterogeneity of the study methods, particularly the exposure assessment, it is not possible to provide an overall quantitative assessment of risk between physical activity and cancer risk.  \n",
      "There is some suggestion for an inverse relation between physical activity and prostate cancer in 16 [39,40,46,48,50,52,53,55,56,60,61,63,64,68,71,72] of the previous 31 studies reviewed here. Of these 16 studies, the risks were significantly reduced in 10 studies [40.46,50,52,56.60,61,63.64.72] for the total population and in 2 other studies [53,71] for subgroups of the study population only; in the remaining 4 studies [39,48,55,68], the risks were inverse but not statistically significant. No overall association between physical activity and prostate cancer was found in 11 studies [41.47.54.57–59.65.67,69.73.74]. An increased risk of prostate cancer among physically active men was found in four studies [37,51.66,70]. Figure 6.1 illustrates the main result for each study.  \n",
      "The magnitude of the overall association ranged from an 80% reduction in prostate cancer risk for the highest activity levels [72] to a 220% increased risk found in one study [70]. The overall results for 21 [37,40.41,46-48,52-55,57-59,61,63,67-69,71,73,74] of the 31 studies were distributed between a 30% reduction to a 30% increase in risk of prostate cancer for the most active men compared to inactive men, with an average risk reduction between 10 to 30%.  \n",
      "The potential dose-response relation of decreasing risk with increasing levels of physical activity was examined in 23 studies [41,46,47,50–55,57,59–61,63–65,67–69,71–74]. A statistically significant trend [46.52.53.61.63.64.72] or borderline statistically significant trend [55.60] of decreasing prostate cancer risk with increasing activity levels was found in nine studies, but two other studies [51,65] observed trends of increasing risk with increasing activity.  \n",
      "No clear pattern of risk decreases or increases by type of activity was found in these studies. Occupational activity was associated with a risk decrease in six studies [39,40,52,56,64,72] and recreational activity decreased risk in seven studies [50,52,55,60,63,74]. Only one study measured all types of physical activity, including occupational, household, and recreational activity [74]. In that study, nonsignificant risk decreases were found for occupational and recreational activity, but an increased risk was observed for household activity [74]. Five studies [46,52,56,73,74] assessed more than one type of activity and presented results for each type of activity and all activities combined. The combined activity variable demonstrated the largest risk reduction in three studies [46,52,56], but not in all studies [73,74].  \n",
      "Similarly, no clear patterns of consistent risk increases or decreases were found in the 14 studies that assessed current activity only [41,46,48,50-56,58-60,66] or in the 16 studies that assessed lifetime occupational activity [39,40,47,57,61,64,65,67,72,73], average recreational activity over lifetime [63], or recreational activity as measured for specific time periods in the past [37,68,69–71]. Only one of these studies has systematically measured all types of activity over an entire lifetime [74]. In that study, lifetime total activity decreased prostate cancer risk by 13% and the risk reduction was not statistically significant.  \n",

      "It would be of interest to know if the association between physical activity and prostate cancer varies by age at diagnosis, family history of prostate cancer, race, or other possible risk factors. Results specific to population subgroups are relevant for formulating hypotheses about the natural history of the disease and the possibility of influencing carcinogenesis during different susceptible periods, for designing and analyzing future studies, and for developing public health guidelines.  \n",
      "For the studies reviewed here, there appeared to be more consistent prostate cancer risk reductions among physically active men in the European studies than in the American studies. Six [46,52,55,60,61,68] of eight [46,52,55,58,60,61,67,68] studies conducted in Europe found risk  \n",
      "decreases compared with only eight [39,40,48,50,56,63,64,72] of twenty [37,39-41,48,50,51,53,54,56,57,59,63-66,69,71,72,74] studies conducted in North America. Europeans have a wider range of recreational and occupational activities because their work is less mechanized and their lifestyles are more active than in North America. This difference in levels of physical activity is also apparent in the higher prevalence of obesity in the U.S. compared to European countries [75].  \n",
      "Relatively few of these previous studies have attempted any type of subgroup analysis. Nine studies have presented results stratified by different age groups [46,65,66,71,73,74], ethnic and racial groups [63,69], or stage of cancer at diagnosis [53]. No consistent subgroup effects have been delineated thus far for these factors. Giovannucci et al. [53] did find a reduction in risk for metastatic prostate cancer cases only that was not found in any other stages of cancers examined in that study. The results for age have been inconsistent because a greater risk reduction was found among older men (≥60 years) for combined occupational and recreational activity in the Norwegian cohort study [46], but the Hawaiian case-control study [65] found an increased risk of prostate cancer among older men (≥70 years) who had the highest occupational activity levels. In the one study that measured all activity from childhood to the reference period (diagnosis date or a comparable time for controls), some evidence for risk reduction for activity done in early life up to age 18 was found. The most physically active upper quartile of men experienced a 22%, nonstatistically significant decreased risk [74].  \n",
      "The most recently published study also examined effect modification by additional risk factors, including body mass index (BMI, kg/m²), family history of prostate cancer, and alcohol intake [74]. In that study, the only evidence for effect modification found was for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer risk for men with a prostate cancer family history in the highest quartile of activity compared to the lowest was reduced by 52%; those without such a history had no risk reduction [74]. BMI was not found to be a risk factor or an effect modifier in this study [76]. Effect modification in the association of physical activity and prostate cancer risk has not yet been adequately investigated.\n",

      "Only one cohort study, conducted by Oliveria et al. [50] in the Aerobics Centre Longitudinal Study, assessed the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and prostate cancer risk. In that cohort, study participants' physical fitness levels were measured at baseline using a maximal exercise treadmill test. A 74% reduction was found in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of fitness level, with clear evidence of a trend across quartiles. Physical fitness is a complex construct that combines various personal physiological and genetic factors. It is correlated with physical activity but cannot be used interchangeably as a surrogate measure for physical activity. Physical fitness is, however, an objective measure that is less likely to be subject to recall bias or recall error. Although measuring physical fitness in epidemiological studies is logistically challenging and infeasible, these preliminary findings are noteworthy and suggest that additional investigations on physical fitness and prostate cancer risk could be worthwhile.\n",

      "To understand how physical activity may be influencing prostate carcinogenesis, the natural history of prostate cancer and possible underlying biological mechanisms need to be understood. The natural history of prostate cancer is still uncertain because the disease progression is highly variable and unpredictable [77,78]. There is, however, agreement that most prostate cancers have a long, presymptomatic, nonmetastatic phase [79]. The prevalence of small prostatic carcinomas, as determined from autopsy series, is nearly 30% in men aged 30 to 40 and over 60% in men aged 60 to 70 [79]. From the PCPT [35] - the chemoprevention trial that included only men without an elevated PSA (<3 ng/ml) who were subsequently biopsied - the prevalence of prostate cancer was found to be higher than anticipated by PSA screening (24% cancer detection in placebo group vs. an expected lifetime incidence of 17%). This rate varies widely internationally because the detection of latent disease depends on the medical practices of each country. The disease course complicates treatment and assessment of etiological factors.  \n",
      "Although the natural history of prostate cancer is still poorly understood, several lines of evidence support a role for endogenous androgens in prostate carcinogenesis, including the following facts:  \n",
      "- Androgens are required for the normal growth and development of the prostate gland.\n",
      "- Large doses of androgens induce prostate cancer in rodents [80]. o\n",
      "- Prostate cancer incidence and benign prostatic hypertrophy are low in castrated men [81]. ●\n",
      "- Androgens stimulate the in vitro proliferation of human prostate cancer cells [82]. o\n",
      "- Castration or estrogen therapy often causes tumor regression and is also an effective palliative treatment for metastatic prostate cancer [83,84].\n",
      "- Increased levels of circulating testosterone, as well as lower levels of estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer [85] but this effect has not been consistently found [86-88].  \n",
      "It is hypothesized that androgens may not be involved in prostate cancer initiation [89] but that an altered hormone metabolism may play a role in the progression of prostate cancer from histological to clinically significant forms |90|.  \n",
      "At least five biological mechanisms have been postulated for how physical activity might reduce the risk of prostate cancer. These mechanisms include alterations in endogenous hormones, energy balance, insulin-like growth factors, immune function, and antioxidant defense mechanisms. It is possible that higher levels of physical activity may affect male sex hormone metabolism by decreasing circulating testosterone. Physical activity may influence prostate carcinogenesis by suppressing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activity via inhibition of 5-0-reductase type II, the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT [91]. The blood level of a distal DHT metabolite, 30-androstanediol glucuronide (3α-diol G), appears to correlate well with levels of activity of 5-o-reductase.  \n",
      "Several studies have shown a weak positive association between serum levels of 30-diol G and prostate cancer risk [86,87]. Athletes have been shown to have lower basal levels of testosterone and individuals who exercise may have a temporary decrease in postexercise levels of testosterone [92-97]. However, the impact of these changes in serum androgen concentrations on the risk of prostate cancer remains unclear. At present, it can only be hypothesized that because endogenous androgens are associated with the development of prostate cancer, men who are more physically active may be at decreased risk of prostate cancer because they may have lower levels of these hormones.  \n",
      "Second, physical activity may affect prostate cancer risk through its influence on energy balance and prevention of obesity and weight gain. Overweight and obesity are inconsistently associated with prostate cancer risk [17]; nonetheless, several possible mechanisms whereby energy balance could influence prostate cancer risk do exist. BMI has been shown to be an important predictor of metabolically active androgen concentrations, and habitual physical activity and BMI were found to be independent predictors of serum testosterone [98]. Reducing body fat stores results in reduced conversion of androgens to estrogens and of estrogens to more potent carcinogens [99,100]. Increased fat intake has been associated with increased prostate cancer risk [101]. Physical activity may alter the metabolism of fat to decrease its carcinogenicity [102]. Low-fat, high-fiber diets have been shown to affect androgen levels by decreasing circulating testosterone [103]. Thus, physical activity, dietary intake, and endogenous hormones may have an inter-related influence on prostate carcinogenesis.  \n",
      "The third possible biological mechanism whereby physical activity may influence prostate cancer risk is through insulin and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis. Evidence from observational epidemiological studies suggests that IGF-1 levels are associated with prostate cancer risk. This association has been observed in populations of symptomatic cases or men identified through surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [104-107], as well as populations of screendetected prostate cancer cases [108]. Experimental studies in humans have shown that men adopting a low-fat diet and daily exercise routine reduced their levels of serum insulin and IGF-1 while increasing their levels of IGFBP-1 and SHBG [109]. A low-fat diet and/or intensive exercise decrease serum hormones and growth factors in vivo that can reduce growth and induce apoptosis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro [110-112]. Furthermore, it appears that these effects are mediated by enhancement of the p53 gene [113]. These results suggest that prostate cancer may be another aspect of the insulin-resistance syndrome purported to be etiologically relevant in other hormone-dependent cancers [109].  \n",
      "The fourth plausible biological mechanism is that physical activity may enhance the immune system by improving the capacity and numbers of natural killer cells [114,115]. Although current evidence suggests that the majority of human cancers are not related to immune function, it is possible that modulation of the immune system by exercise can inhibit cancer development (through immune enhancement) and promote cancer (through immune suppression) [116]. Experimental studies have found that exercise can improve the innate immune mechanisms [117-119]. Immune function is known to decrease with aging and may account, in part, for the increased risk of cancer with aging [120]. Cross-sectional studies conducted among elderly populations have found significantly higher T-cell function among study participants who exercised regularly compared to those who were sedentary [121]. Exercise can induce changes in the activity of macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and regulating cytokines; however, further research is needed before it can be asserted that these changes have a substantial influence on cancer risk [122] because several different immune function mechanisms may contribute to the lowered cancer risk of the physically active [123]. If an association between cancer risk and immunity exists, it remains poorly understood at present and it may make a minor contribution.  \n",
      "Finally, physical activity may generate reactive oxygen species (i.e., free radicals) [124]. Acute exercise may promote free radical production while chronic exercise improves free radical defenses by up-regulating the activities of key free radical scavenger enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and levels of antioxidants (i.e., glutathione and tocopherols) [125]. Thus, the borderline between beneficial and noxious effects of physical activity depends on several factors, including the health status, age, level of training, and nutritional status of the individual [126]. Radical scavenger supplementation (e.g., antioxidant vitamins, metal ion chelators, coenzyme Q, and glutathione precursors) may improve the positive effects of exercise and provide more protection to the body against so-called oxidative stress. Antioxidants obtained from dietary sources have already been hypothesized to reduce prostate cancer risk, so a comparable causal mechanism may exist for antioxidants resulting from physical activity [127]. The extent to which these exerciseinduced changes in oxidant defense influence cancer risk is still unknown.\n",

      "group. Only 2 [69,74] of the previous 12 case-control studies [63-74] attempted to address the issue of undetected prostate cancer in the control population and stage of cancer in the case population. The multicenter case-control study by Whittemore et al. [69] included testing of PSA levels in the controls for most of the centers involved and staging of the cases into localized vs. advanced categories. The controls were stratified in the analysis into two groups, according to PSA levels taken shortly after the interview. The population-based case-control study by Friedenreich et al. [74] included only stage T2 or greater cases in an attempt to make the comparison with the controls more valid by excluding any T1 cases that were incidentally detected.  \n",
      "The results of the remaining case-control studies, as well as the cohort studies, were likely influenced by some misclassification of outcome among the controls because the prevalence of undetected prostate cancer among men in the age ranges relevant for prostate cancer incidence is about 20 to 40% [128]. The effect of undetected cancer among the controls would be to bias the results towards the null. Thus, one possible explanation for the weak associations found in these studies could be the effect of differential misclassification bias.  \n",
      "In studies that have been conducted since PSA tests for screening were commonly introduced (late 1980s for North American countries, early 1990s for European countries and later for Asian countries), a number of lower stage prostate cancer cases could have been included in the case group because they were detected due to an elevated PSA level rather than because of clinical symptoms. Among the studies reviewed here, it was found that, on average, the more recent studies were less likely to show an effect of physical activity on prostate cancer risk than were the earlier studies.  \n",
      "It was previously noted that Giovannucci et al. [53] observed a risk reduction only among the metastatic cases. One explanation is that there has been outcome misclassification in recent studies that have not removed lower stage (e.g., T1) cases from the case group to ensure a more valid comparison with the controls. Because a large proportion of men have undetected, latent prostate cancer, the controls in these studies might have included cases unless some measure was taken to ensure that the controls were actually free of prostate cancer. It is also possible that men became cases solely because of elevated PSA levels detected through routine screening and that these incidental cancers would never have been clinically detected [129]. Therefore, outcome misclassification is possible in the case and control groups because of the nature of prostate carcinogenesis and the methods used for its detection.\n",

      "Some of the inconsistencies observed in these investigations are likely attributable to the differences in the physical activity assessment methods used. The main problems include crude classification systems for physical activity, incomplete measurement of all the parameters of physical activity and all time periods of life, and the lack of validated and reliable instruments.  \n",
      "An individual measurement of activity was made for some of the studies that measured recreational or occupational activity [41.43.50-54.63.65.66.68,70] or leisure and work activity [46.48.55-57.60.69.70-74], but not for some of the occupational studies [39.40,47.61.64.67] or recreational studies [37,58] that used a group assignment of activity. Exposure misclassification could have occurred for the studies that used the job title as a measure for physical activity rather than an individual assessment of actual occupational activity performed.  \n",
      "Only 9 of the 31 studies [48,50,53,55,70–74] measured the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity directly from the study subjects. Two other studies [39,59] combined information on frequency, intensity, and duration into a single measure of energy expenditure with intensitv assigned by the investigators based on available literature. It is currently still unclear what frequency, duration, and intensity of activity are required for a prostate cancer risk reduction or what combination of these components of activity will influence risk. For example, a certain intensity level may be necessary for physical activity to have an influence on prostate cancer risk via a biological  \n",
      "mechanism that involves androgen hormones. Friedenreich et al. [74] observed a 30% statistically significant risk reduction for vigorous intensity activity for men in the highest quartile of hours per week per year of all types of activity combined. No clear comparable pattern of risk reduction was observed when examining the association by frequency and duration only [74].  \n",
      "The time period in a man's life when physical activity is most etiologically relevant has only been fully addressed in one study thus far [74]. Because the prostate is a hormone-dependent organ that undergoes significant changes at different time periods in life, there may be particularly susceptible time periods when physical activity may have more influence on carcinogenesis. More studies are needed that measure activity and assess risk throughout a man's life before recommendations can be made regarding which time periods are most etiologically important for a risk reduction.  \n",
      "Only four studies tested the instrument for reliability and validity [41,46,53,59]. In the Hawaiian cohort study [41], a 24-hour activity grid was used that was derived from a measurement instrument developed and tested for reliability and validity in the Framingham Heart Study [130]. In the Norwegian cohort study [46], repeated assessments of activity as well as objective measures of fitness (e.g., fitness tests and heart rate measures) and metabolic risk profiles were performed to examine the reliability and validity of the instrument used [131]. The validity and reproducibility of the physical activity questionnaire used in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [53] were investigated in a subset of the cohort [132]. In the Harvard Health Alumni study [59], university records were used to determine the approximate frequency and duration of physical activity in which study subjects engaged during their college years. Although these measurements are not subject to recall bias, because they are based on records rather than self-report they still suffer from the same limitations as the other studies because they did not measure the intensity of activity. Later measures of physical activity in this study [59] were based on a questionnaire, the validity of which had been tested against other physical activity questionnaires and physiological measures. The reliability, but not the validity, of the lifetime total physical activity questionnaire used in the Alberta case-control study was previously established [133].\n",

      "Because the underlying biological model and mechanisms operative in the association between physical activity and prostate cancer are unclear, epidemiological studies need to incorporate and examine a wide range of possible confounders and effect modifiers. Possible confounding factors include diet and alcohol intake, socioeconomic status, smoking, ethnicity, family history of cancer, and, possibly, reproductive and medical factors [2,5,6]. Possible effect modifiers are anthropometric factors, endogenous hormone levels, and age. Height has been shown to be a risk factor for prostate cancer but the data are inconsistent for BMI, waist-hip ratio, and weight [17]. Height is influenced by genetic factors, but also by exposure before and during puberty to androgens that are also implicated in the normal development of the prostate gland. Physical activity may influence the level of endogenous androgens around the time of puberty through its influence on height and weight.  \n",
      "Residual confounding may have influenced a number of the previous studies that did not assess confounding completely. Three of the epidemiological studies reviewed here did not adjust for any confounders [38,58,66]; five adjusted for age only [39,40,47,57,63]; 16 adjusted for some prostate cancer risk factors [41,46,48,50.51,54-56,59-61,64,65,67,68,70]; and seven studies measured and controlled for most of these risk factors [52,53,69,71-74].  \n",
      "The main risk factor that was not measured and controlled for in the majority of the studies was dietary intake. The biological mechanism whereby dietary fat mediates an influence on prostate cancer risk is thought to be through endogenous hormones [103]. Although the interaction of steroid hormones with the development of prostate cancer is poorly understood at present, studies have found that a low-fat, high-fiber diet decreases circulating testosterone [134-136]. Physical activity  \n",
      "may also mediate prostate cancer risk through its influence on endogenous hormones and physically active individuals may have diets that differ systematically from inactive people; therefore, dietary intake is a key factor that needs to be measured and controlled for in epidemiological studies of physical activity and prostate cancer risk.  \n",
      "Confounding by unmeasured and uncontrolled behavioral factors associated with being physically active may also explain, in part, the possible association between physical activity and prostate cancer risk. It is possible that individuals who are physically active are lean, generally healthier, and nonsmokers, seek medical care more readily, and generally exhibit other healthy behaviors that contribute to their observed reduction in risk of prostate cancer.  \n",
      "Some of the discrepancies in the study results may be attributable to underlying differences in the characteristics of the subjects included. It is therefore important that future research studies examine the modifying effects of physical activity within defined strata of other prostate cancer risk factors, particularly because such analyses may provide insights into biological mechanisms. It would be useful to examine relationships by age, body size, body fat distribution patterns, and dietary intake - to name just a few of the major risk factors. Such analyses will need to ensure that adequate power exists for meaningful interpretations of the subgroup effects.\n",

      "Overall, previous epidemiological studies indicate that physical activity may decrease the risk of prostate cancer; however, the association is relatively weak and considerable inconsistency exists across these studies. Given this inconsistency and the lack of understanding of the precise role of physical activity in prostate cancer etiology, numerous questions remain to be answered. Research priorities can be categorized into research on: (1) physical activity assessment methods; (2) etiological studies; and (3) biological mechanisms.  \n",
      "The validity of different physical activity assessment methods needs to be improved and the reliability of these methods assessed. Future studies need to measure all types of physical activity (occupational, recreational, household) and all components of physical activity (frequency, intensity and duration) across entire lifetimes. Direct measures of physical activity and fitness should also be included in addition to the subjective measures. New research on assessment methods should consider the underlying biological mechanisms in the design and evaluation of these tools.  \n",
      "Additional etiological studies on a larger scale that measure activity appropriately and include complete assessments of confounding and effect modification are needed. For future prospective studies, repeat measures of activity and any confounders that may change over time, such as dietary intake, are needed so that information pertaining to all time periods being measured is available. A full assessment of confounders will also assist in distinguishing the independent role of physical activity as an etiological risk factor for prostate cancer separate from its contribution to a healthy lifestyle. Studies within different ethnic and racial groups are also needed, as well as studies that examine the risk by different stages of prostate cancer.  \n",
      "Finally, additional research on the possible biological mechanisms for the role of physical activity on prostate risk is needed. At least five major mechanisms were reviewed here, including an influence of physical activity on endogenous hormones, energy balance, insulin-like growth factors, immune function, and antioxidant defenses. Experimental studies in animal and human models that examine how physical activity influences each of these biological mechanisms would provide important insights into the etiology of prostate cancer. These studies could examine how age, time of life, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of activity influence these different biological mechanisms. A better understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer would provide useful insights in the design and conduct of future etiological studies of physical activity and prostate cancer. In particular, possible surrogate endpoints that could be used as biomarkers of prostate cancer risk in future prospective etiological studies and intervention trials are also needed [137.138].\n",

      "Currently, the epidemiological evidence for an etiological role of physical activity in prostate carcinogenesis remains weak and inconsistent. Although several possible biological mechanisms can be hypothesized for this putative association, additional well-designed and appropriately conducted observational studies are needed to elucidate the nature of this association more completely before intervention research on the biological mechanisms would be justified. Prostate cancer remains an important cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among men and few modifiable lifestyle risk factors appear to be strongly associated with prostate cancer; thus, physical activity as a means for the primary prevention for prostate cancer merits further research consideration.\n",

      "One hypothesized mechanism explaining the association between increased physical activity and reduced risk for incidence of some cancers is the effect of physical activity on sex hormones [1]. This is most relevant to certain hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrium, and possibly prostate. Women with elevated concentrations of estrogens and androgens have increased risk for breast cancer [2], and those with elevated estrogen concentrations without counterbalancing elevated progesterone concentrations are at increased risk for endometrial cancer [3]. Several cohort and nested case-control studies have examined the relationship between sex hormones and prostate cancer [4,5]. The largest of these studies, a nested case-control study with 222 cases and 390 controls from a cohort of 22,071 U.S. male physicians found that men in the highest quartile of testosterone concentration were more than two times as likely as men in the lowest quantile of testosterone levels to develop prostate cancer [6].  \n",
      "Events of early and late menstrual and reproductive life may be important in the induction or promotion of hormonally related cancers such as breast and endometrium. Early menarche (before 12), increased numbers of ovulatory cycles, late first birth or nulliparity, lack of lactation, and late menopause have each been found to increase risk of breast cancer from 20% to 100% [7]. Increased number of lifetime ovulatory cycles and cyclic estrogen has been proposed as a significant risk factor for breast cancer [8]. This chapter reviews the observational and clinical trial data linking physical activity to sex hormones in premenopausal women, postmenopausal women, and men.\n",

      "A small number of observational studies have reported on a link between physical activity and menstrual and reproductive factors including sex hormones. One reason for this lack of data is the challenge of timing of blood collection by day of menstrual cycle. This is relevant because the within-woman variability in the estrogen and progesterone concentrations over the menstrual cycle exceeds the between-woman variability of these hormones.  \n",
      "Girls participating in vigorous sports such as ballet dancing and running experience a high incidence of primary and secondary amenorrhea, delayed menarche, and more irregular cycles compared with nonathlete girls [9,10]. A cross-sectional study of 174 girls aged 14 to 17 years found that girls who expended 600 or more kcal energy per week (described by the authors as comparable to 2 or more hours per week in activities such as aerobic exercise classes, swimming, jogging, or tennis) were two to three times more likely than less active girls to have anovulatory menstrual cycles [7].  \n",
      "In a sample of 636 women aged 20 to 44 years from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study, several hormones were assayed and correlated with lifestyle and other factors [11]. Women were regularly menstruating and had a most recent menstrual cycle of less than 40 days. The day of menstrual cycle was carefully recorded, and a subsample were assayed for progesterone at day 10 to -21 and for follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone at day -6 to -21. Physical activity was assessed by questionnaire and included data on physical activity at work (sedentary occupation, standing occupation, manual work) and vigorous recreational exercise (none, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, or ≥5 hours per week). After multivariate adjustment, including day of cycle, estradiol concentrations decreased with increasing amount of vigorous recreational exercise (p-trend = 0.04). Estradiol also decreased with increasing physical activity at work (p-trend = 0.09).  \n",
      "Other studies suggest that recreational exercisers may have lower mean reproductive hormone levels and longer menstrual cycle lengths, although the individual effects of weight control and physical activity are difficult to discern [12-14].\n",

      "A handful of intervention studies have tested chronic exercise effect on menstrual factors or sex hormones in premenopausal women. Most have been very small; sample sizes ranged from 4 to 31 in five of the studies and one study randomized 132 subjects but only 57 completed the study. Thus, the information available from carefully controlled studies is scarce.  \n",
      "In the largest published clinical trial, Bonen et al. randomized 132 women aged 18 to 40 years to one of six jogging exercise programs for 2 or 4 months: <10 miles/week; 10 to 20 miles/week; or 20 to 30 miles/week [15]. There was no control group. Women were followed for nine menstrual cycles. Results were only presented for the 57 who completed the entire study. The researchers found no change in luteinizing hormone concentration, menstrual cycle length, or luteal phase length. Also, no trend was found toward increased change in follicle-stimulating hormone or progesterone with increasing physical activity. Body weight or percent body fat did not change, despite a significant increase in cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max) in all study arms (p < 0.05). The authors concluded that recreational running of up to 30 miles/week for four menstrual cycles had no deleterious effect on menstrual cycle. This study had the benefit of a randomized design with long follow-up. The considerable dropout rate (75 out of 132), however, limits the interpretation of study results.  \n",
      "Investigators in Boston published two reports from a randomized clinical trial of weight loss vs. weight maintenance in 31 untrained college-aged women [16,17]. All women received the same exercise prescription of 10 miles/day running plus 3.5 hours/day of sports. All activities took place during 8 weeks at a college training camp. Food intake was carefully prescribed and controlled by camp dieticians. Overnight urine was collected daily. During the intervention, 18 women developed loss of luteneizing hormone surge (64%), 13 experienced delayed menses, and 18 developed luteal phase defects. In the weight-loss arm, 75% of the women had delayed menses vs. 8% of women in the weight-maintenance arm (p < 0.005). Similarly, 81% of women in the weight-loss arm experienced loss of luteneizing hormone surge vs. 42% of women in the weight-maintenance group (p < .05). Incidence of luteal phase defects between the two groups did not differ. All subjects were experiencing normal menstrual cycles 6 months after termination of the intervention. The authors interpret their study as suggesting that vigorous exercise, especially in conjunction with weight loss, can result in reversibly disturbed reproductive function.  \n",
      "In a very small study, four women aged 25 to 29 years were assigned in random order to one of three conditions of 1-week duration during the early follicular phase of the cycle: control, exercise, and exercise with energy restriction [18]. Women were followed for three menstrual cycles. Exercise alone had no effect on luteneizing hormone pulse frequency, level, or peak amplitude. However, diet plus exercise caused a decrease in luteneizing hormone pulse frequency compared with control condition and exercise alone (p < 0.05).  \n",
      "In a later study by Williams et al., 15 women were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sedentary control, active control (jogging or cycling 45 minutes/day, 2 to 3 days/week), training during follicular phase of menstrual cycle, or training during luteal phase of the cycle [19]. The training consisted of twice daily running or cycling for five days/week. The exercise bouts consisted of running 3.2 km per exercise bout increasing by 1.2 km/bout each week. The training lasted through two menstrual cycles. Diet was controlled to maintain weight within ±2 kg of baseline weight. At the end of the intervention, almost half of the trained women showed evidence of abnormal luteal function, including short luteal defects and low urinary progesterone. None experienced loss of luteneizing hormone surge, and none had delayed menses or abnormal bleeding. The changes in luteal function were observed in both training groups, suggesting that exercise at any time in the cycle can affect menstrual function.  \n",
      "In the HERITAGE Family Study, parents and their adult sons and daughters completed a 20week endurance training program (3 days/week gradually increased to 75% VO, max for 50 minutes) on cycle ergometers [20]. On average, sex hormone-binding globulin increased 3.4 nmol/L in the daughters (mean age 25.5) but decreased an average 7.9 nmol/L in their premenopausal mothers (mean age 48.6).  \n",
      "A high-intensity exercise intervention in 28 untrained college women with normal ovulation and luteal adequacy resulted in reversible abnormal luteal function in two-thirds and loss of luteinizing hormone surge in over half of the subjects [21]. The most marked disturbances were observed during the periods of most intense training and in women who had been randomized to a weight-loss (vs. weight-maintenance) group.  \n",
      "Although exercise effects on menarche, menstrual cycle characteristics, and endogenous sex hormones in girls and young women is often cited as a potential mechanism relating exercise to breast cancer risk, the existing evidence comes from inadequately powered intervention studies, many of which were not randomized clinical trials. Data are still lacking on the requirements to produce menstrual and hormone effects, including the amount, frequency, and type of exercise needed; the age at which a girl or woman needs to begin exercising; whether body mass and body fat must be kept low; and what type of dietary pattern is optimal. Data from primate animal models strongly suggest that negative energy balance is responsible for physical activity effects on menstrual cycle characteristics and sex hormones in reproductive years [22].\n",

      "Increased physical activity measured through self-report and by movement monitors has been found to be associated with decreased serum concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and androgens after adjustment for body mass index in postmenopausal women in some [23] but not other [11] studies. Increased physical activity is also associated with increased circulating concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin in women [24], which competitively binds to estrogens and androgens, resulting in lower amounts of free, active hormones in the circulation.\n",

Women were eligible if they were aged 50 to 75 years, not using sex hormones, sedentary, nonsmokers, willing to be randomized, had no endocrine-related disease or cancer, had a body mass index greater than 24.0 and a percent body fat of 33.0 or greater. Subjects were recruited through mass mailings, supplemented with media placements.  \n",
      "A total of 173 women was randomized to a 1-year moderate intensity aerobic and strength training physical activity program (monitored group exercise sessions with an exercise physiologist plus home exercise) or a control program (stretching classes). The aerobic exercise intervention consisted of thrice weekly exercise sessions at a study facility and twice weekly home exercise sessions. The facility aerobic exercise sessions consisted of 45 minutes of endurance exercise (treadmill and bike) at 70 to 85% of maximal heart rate. Home exercise sessions consisted of aerobic exercises of the women's choice. All 173 women provided blood at 3-months follow-up, and 170 provided blood at 12-months follow-up. On average over the 12 months, the exercisers participated in moderate-intensity sports/recreational activity for a mean 3.7 ± 1.4 days/week for a total of 171 ± 87.9 minutes/week (vs. goal 225 minutes/week). Six (8%) exercisers dropped out of the intervention (all after 3 months) [28]. On average, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO, max) increased in exercisers by 12.7% and in controls by 0.8% (p < 0.0001).  \n",
      "At 3 and 12 months, women in the exercise group experienced 3.8 and 1.8% declines in estrone, respectively, compared with increases of 3.4 and 3.9% in controls (p = 0.03 and 0.13) [26]. Exercisers experienced a 7.7% decline in estradiol at 3 months, compared with a decline of just 0.6% in controls (p = 0.07); at 12 months, the decline in exercisers was present but attenuated. Sex hormone-binding globulin increased from baseline to 3 and 12 months in exercisers to a larger degree than controls, but the differences were of only marginal statistical significance. Exercisers had an 8.2% decrease in free estradiol from baseline to 3 months, compared with no change in controls (p = 0.02). At 12 months, the decline in estradiol in exercisers was slightly less than at 3 months.  \n",
      "Figure 7.1 to Figure 7.3 show the exercise effects on estrogens by change in body fat. Among the exercisers who lost more than 2% body fat, concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol decreased by 11.9, 13.7, and 16.7%, respectively, at 12 months. In contrast, among the controls who lost body fat, concentrations of estradiol and free estradiol increased and estrone decreased by just 3.6%. Comparisons of these changes between exercisers and controls for those who lost body fat were statistically significant for estradiol and free estradiol.  \n",
      "Women in the exercise and control groups experienced similar, nonsignificant declines in testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandiosterone (DHEA), and dehydroepiandiosteronesulfate (DHEA-S) from baseline to 3 and 12 months, so the comparison of change over time between exercisers and controls was not statistically significant [27]. Exercisers experienced a 6.5% decline  \n",

      "in free testosterone from baseline to 3 and 12 months, compared with a 2.1% decline in controls (p = 0.28 and 0.42, respectively).  \n",
      "Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5 show the exercise effects on androgens by change in body fat. At 3 and 12 months, androgen concentrations decreased to a greater extent among exercisers who lost at least 0.5% body fat vs. exercisers who did not lose body fat. Among women who lost between 0.5 and 2% body fat, exercisers' testosterone declined by 1.5 and 4.7%, respectively, at 3 and 12 months; in controls, it did not change at 3 months and declined by only 2.8% at 12 months (p = 0.02 and 0.03, compared to exercisers, respectively). Among those who lost more than 2% body fat, exercisers' testosterone declined by 10.1 and 8.0%, respectively, at 3 and 12 months, and in controls it declined by only 1.6 and 3.6% (p=0.005 and 0.02, compared to exercisers, respectively).  \n",
      "FIGURE 7.4 Percent change in testosterone by percent fat change.  \n",
      "FIGURE 7.5 Percent change in free testosterone by percent fat change.  \n",
      "Among women who lost between 0.5 and 2% body fat, exercisers' 12-month free testosterone declined by 10.4%, but in controls it declined by only 4.3% (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Among those who lost more than 2% body fat, exercisers' 12-month free testosterone declined by 12.2% and by only 8.0% (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively) in controls. Although not statistically significant, exercisers vs. controls who lost more than 2% body fat had greater 12-month changes in androstenedione (-17.1 vs. -9.2%, respectively), DHEA (-20.0 vs. -8.2%, respectively), and DHEAS (-21.8 vs. +3.3%, respectively).  \n",
      "As previously reviewed, human estrogen metabolism is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes [29]. Two of the major hydroxylated metabolites of estrone are 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH E, ) and 1602-hydroxyestrone (160-OH E, ). These metabolites are produced by competing pathways and have different properties. 2-OH E; is weakly estrogenic; in vitro studies and animal models have suggested that it is anticarcinogenic. In contrast, 160 -OH E, is more estrogenic, has been shown to form covalent bonds with estrogen receptors, and may be genotoxic. One hypothesis is that urinary excretion of these estrogen metabolites can be used as a risk marker for breast cancer. Some [30-33] but not all [34] epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of breast cancer associated with low urinary excretion of 2-OH E, relative to 16α-OH E ..  \n",
      "In the clinical trial described earlier (the Physical Activity for Total Health Study), the effects of a 12-month moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention on urinary 2-OH E., 160-OH E., and their ratio in postmenopausal women [29] were determined. Urinary 2- and 16α-OH E, were measured in spot urines collected at baseline, 3, and 12 months. Overall, no significant effects of the exercise intervention on 2-OH E1, 1602-OH E1, or their ratio (p > 0.05) were found.  \n",
      "Analyses are under way to determine the effect of various genetic polymorphisms related to hormone production and metabolism on the effect of exercise on sex hormones in the Physical Activity for Total Health Study. As described in Chapter 12, the Alpha Trial under way in Alberta, Canada (Drs. C. Friedenreich and K. Courneya, principal and coprincipal investigators respectively) is testing a similar exercise intervention to the Physical Activity for Total Health Study in over 300 postmenopausal women.\n",

      "Previous research in athletes suggests that exercise decreases testosterone concentrations chronically [36,37], but the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention on sex hormones in previously sedentary middle-aged to older men is unknown. Exercise appears to acutely increase testosterone concentrations [38], but preliminary evidence suggests that long-term endurance exercise reduces testosterone concentrations [39]. Some researchers suggest a threshold level of physical activity needed before testosterone levels decrease significantly in men [40].  \n",
      "An ancillary study to a completed clinical trial (the APPEAL study; see Chapter 12) is testing the effect of a 1-year moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program vs. control on sex hormones in previously sedentary men aged 45 to 75. The hormones to be assessed are testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and estradiol. Sex hormone-binding globulin will also be measured and free testosterone and free estradiol will be calculated [41]. Blood was collected and stored prerandomization and at months 3 and 12 of follow-up, and is available for 100 of the 102 enrolled men. Results will be available in 2005.\n",

      "Several exercise intervention studies have been conducted in cancer patients. However, the endpoints have focused on weight, physical function, and quality of life and have not provided data on effects on sex hormones. These studies are reviewed in full in the chapters in Section III of this book. In a small pilot study, an 8-week exercise-low-fat diet intervention resulted in significant reductions in weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and percent body fat in nine breast cancer patients aged 40 to 74 years [42]. Slight, nonsignificant decreases were observed in serum concentrations of total and free estradiol, estrone sulfate, total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin.\n",

      "Physical activity may affect sex hormone concentrations in women and men - directly via effects on trophic organs and indirectly via physical activity effects on adiposity, a substrate for estrogen and testosterone production. This nonsex-organ hormone production can result in excessive amounts of circulating and tissue hormone, which can affect the process of carcinogenesis in women and in men.  \n",
      "Because of the paucity of randomized controlled trial data, it is not yet established that change in physical activity can affect sex hormone concentrations independently of an effect of physical activity on adiposity. How much physical activity or what type would be needed to change hormones is also not clear. Additionally, the separate and combined effects of physical activity, diet patterns, and adiposity are not known. Future research should address these issues in randomized controlled trials, preferably with separate and combined physical activity and dietary interventions in a single trial. Future research should also assess the effects of physical activity on sex hormones in women and men from various races, ethnicities, ages, and geographic areas. Also, the role of genetics in modifying the effects of physical activity on sex hormone concentrations should be explored.\n",

      "According to the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer Prevention, it is recommended that individuals be physically active. Similar to recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society recommends that individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight by being moderately active for at least 30 min on 5 or more days per week to reduce the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [1,2]. In addition, although it is not fully understood why physical activity may play an integral role in the management and survival of cancer, it has been shown that regular physical activity can reduce fatigue and anxiety in cancer patients and improve quality of life [3-5]. Exercise may also improve the lean body mass-to-fat mass ratio, increase range of motion and stability, and promote stress reduction in cancer patients and survivors.  \n",
      "Research in this area has shown that exercise may improve known risk factors for several chronic diseases. The focus of this chapter will be on elucidating potential underlying mechanisms by which physical activity can decrease the risk of several chronic diseases, including several cancers - namely, insulin resistance (defects in insulin action; a reduction in the rate of glucose disposal elicited by a given insulin concentration [6]) and hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood levels of insulin). Some evidence indicates that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may play roles in increasing the risk of several cancers, including breast [7-12], colorectal [12,13], pancreas [14,15], endometrium [14], and stomach [12]. In addition, studies have shown elevated serum insulin concentrations in individuals with cancer but void of other diseases related to hyperinsulinemia [15-17], and impaired glucose tolerance has been found to be an independent predictor for cancer mortality [18].  \n",
      "Expanded molecular-based research examining the relationship between exercise and insulin resistance has been reported. Researchers have shown that physical exercise has the ability to  \n",
      "enhance insulin sensitivity [19-25] as well as decrease levels of insulin and bioavailable insulinlike growth factor (IGF)-1, both of which enhance division of normal cells and inhibit cell death (a process known as apoptosis) [26]. There is also clear evidence that regular exercise reduces insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [20,21,27]. However, not all studies have shown that exercise can have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity [22-25].\n",

Results from the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), using measured heights and weights, indicate that an estimated 64% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese [29]. This represents a prevalence approximately 8% higher than the age-adjusted overweight estimates obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988–1994) [29]. Nearly 59 million American adults are obese, and the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled in the last 20 years. Of Americans aged 6 to 19 years, 15% are overweight [31]. According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 200 million obese adults worldwide and another 18 million children under age 5 classified as overweight as of 1995. However, as of 2000, the number of obese adults increased to over 300 million. Crude projections, from extrapolating existing data, suggest that, by 2025, levels of obesity could be as high as 45 to 50% in the U.S.; between 30 and 40% in Australia, England, and Mauritius; and over 20% in Brazil [30].  \n",
      "Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with an increased risk for type-2 diabetes [32], coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke [33], and several cancers [34-37]. Epidemiological studies have shown positive associations between various measures of overweight and adiposity and a variety of cancers. The International Agency for Research of Cancer concluded that a moderate to strong association exists between increased body weight and increased risk of colon, kidney, esophagus, endometrium, thyroid, and postmenopausal breast cancer [37]. In addition, the International Agency for Research of Cancer has estimated that between one-fourth and one-third of cancer cases may be attributable to the combined effects of elevated body weight and inadequate physical exercise. Other obesity-related chronic diseases include hypertension, osteoarthritis, and gallbladder disease [38] and the number of comorbidities is highly correlated with the rise in body weight. For example, a BMI above 35 kg/m² is associated with a 93-fold and 42-fold increase in the risk of type-2 diabetes in women and men, respectively. With a 20% rise in body weight the risk of coronary heart disease is increased 86% in men and 360% in women [39].  \n",
      "An inverse association between physical activity and body weight has been reported in several cross-sectional epidemiological studies [40]. Furthermore, several large-scale prospective observational studies have shown that higher physical activity has resulted in an attenuated weight gain or lower odds of significant weight gain [41]. Evidence suggests that regular physical activity plays a greater role in attenuating age-related weight gain, rather than promoting weight loss [40]. The amount of physical activity needed to prevent weight gain or to lose weight is unknown. The American College of Sports Medicine and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \n",

      "Due to several variables, such as the individual's body weight, nutritional status, and principles of training such as the frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise, it is difficult to measure adequately the amount of physical activity required to promote weight loss. However, several studies have supported the role of physical activity in the promotion of weight loss and weight maintenance [42]. A meta-analysis including 28 publications concluded that aerobic exercise without dietary restriction among men caused a weight loss of 3 kg in 30 weeks compared with sedentary controls and 1.4 kg in 12 weeks among women [43]. In addition, physical activity has favorable effects on reducing insulin resistance among obese subjects [44,45].\n",

      "From 1980 through 2002, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled (from 5.8 million to 13.3 million) [46]. This shows an increased prevalence compared to data from the NHANES III (1988–1994), which estimated that diagnosed diabetes was 5.5% for U.S. adults (220 years of age), or 10.2 million people when extrapolated to the 1997 U.S. population. Using the 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl) was 2.7% (5.4 million) and the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (110 to 125 mg/dl) was 6.9% (13.4 million) [47]. Using the new minimum criterion for impaired fasting glucose from 100 mg/dl to 125 mg/dl [48], the total prevalence of impaired fasting glucose using the NHANES 1999–2000 dataset would increase from 6.9 to 24.1% [49]. In addition, the worldwide prevalence of type-2 diabetes is estimated to be around 120 million people and has been predicted to almost double to 215 million people by the year 2010 [501.  \n",
      "The pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes involves defects in insulin action (insulin resistance) and secretion (insulin deficiency) [51] manifested by several characteristics, including impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. In addition, the insulin resistance syndrome (also known as the metabolic syndrome or syndrome X) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia [52], and, by some definitions, high urate concentrations [53]. Insulin resistance has also been correlated with several inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, interleukin receptor agonist, and C-reactive protein [54]. Risk factors for the development of type-2 diabetes include increased age, minority ethnicity, family history, prior history of gestational diabetes [55], increased overall obesity [55–58], increased intra-abdominal fat distribution [56–62], and lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity [60], diet, and parity [59].  \n",
      "Several epidemiological studies have determined that regular physical exercise can reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes [63-66] and modest changes in diet and physical activity have been shown to decrease this risk by 58% [67,68]. In addition, a prospective study of 5159 men aged 40 to 59 years with an average follow-up period of 16.8 years found that a moderate level of physical activity was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of hyperinsulinemia, a 30% reduction in the risk of hypertriglyceridemia, and a 25% reduction in the risk of low HDL cholesterol [69]. A single exercise bout has been found to improve insulin resistance among those with type-2 diabetes [70.71]; however, 7 consecutive days of exercise and not a single bout of exercise were needed to improve insulin resistance in some subjects [72]. According to the American College of Sports Medicine's position regarding exercise and type-2 diabetes, individuals should strive to achieve a minimum cumulative total of 1000 kcal/week from physical activities [73]. In addition. because high-intensity exercise has been shown to increase blood glucose concentrations 1741 and insulin resistance [72] in some patients, low- to moderate-intensity exercise is recommended for many diabetics [73].\n",

      "The pathogenesis of insulin resistance is multifaceted. Major causes of acquired insulin resistance include aging, genetics, pregnancy, lack of physical activity, and obesity [81]. Furthermore, several hormones and regulatory factors affect insulin action and may contribute to insulin resistance, especially that observed in obesity. These include chronic hyperglycemia and increased free fatty acids [82]. Several molecular, intracellular, and systemic mechanisms of action occur during and after exercise to attenuate chronic disease risk due to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. In addition, lifestyle factors, including physical activity and physical inactivity, may stimulate the expression of several genes at multiple levels (e.g., pretranslational, translational, or posttranslational); these, in turn, may affect insulin resistance [83].  \n",
      "Skeletal muscle is a major site of insulin resistance [84] and involves dysregulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism [85]. In the exercising muscle, the increased need for metabolic fuel is met partially through an increase in the uptake and utilization of glucose [83]. The degree of glycogen depletion resulting from prior exercise or caloric depletion is an important factor in determining the rate and duration of the increase in muscle glucose uptake during and after exercise [86]. Glucose transport in skeletal muscle occurs primarily by facilitated diffusion utilizing glucose transporter carrier proteins. The major glucose transporter protein expressed in skeletal muscle is the glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4). It has been shown that the insulin resistance in skeletal muscle results from alterations in the translocation, docking, or fusion of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane or the T-tubules, or potentially from changes in the specific activity of the transporters. Physical training increases muscle GLUT4 protein and mRNA in individuals with type-2 diabetes, as well as in healthy subjects [87].  \n",
      "Insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation is an important intermediary step in the process of GLUT4 translocation, and alterations in insulin-receptor substrate 1 or other insulin receptor substrates have been postulated to play a role in insulin resistance [88]. Animal models have shown that exercise leads to increased expression and function of several proteins involved in insulin-signal transduction and differential responses of insulin-receptor substrates 1 and 2 [89]. Normally, after stimulation by insulin, insulin-receptor substrate 1 serves as a docking protein that facilitates phosphorylation of other intracellular proteins such as phosphatidylinositol kinase [88]. Phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI 3-kinase) may be an important effector in the pathway by which GLUT4 transporters are inserted into the plasma membrane. Insulin-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase has been shown to be impaired in skeletal muscle in humans with obesity [90] and type-2 diabetes mellitus [91].  \n",
      "Interestingly, several studies have shown that exercise and insulin stimulate glucose uptake through distinct mechanisms [83,86] and research has shown that insulin and exercise recruit GLUT4 from two distinct intracellular storage sites in skeletal muscle [92]. Insulin utilizes a phosphatidylinositol-kinase-dependent mechanism, whereas the exercise signal may be initiated by calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or from autocrine- or paracrine-mediated activation of glucose transport [86]. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle involves many proteins (including the GTP-binding protein Rab4) that are not involved in exercise-stimulated GLUT4 translocation [93].  \n",
      "Bierman et al. [94] first reported that plasma free fatty acids were elevated in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and subsequent studies have extended these findings to include nondiabetic insulin-resistant individuals, obese patients, and first-degree relatives of type-2 diabetic patients [95]. Elevated free fatty acids have been shown to produce insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner acutely and chronically [95,96], and plasma free fatty acid concentrations correlate with the degree of hyperglycemia, skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and the risk of developing type-2 diabetes [95]. Elevated free fatty acids have been shown to alter insulin signaling [97], abolish the increase in insulin-receptor substrate 1-associated phosphatidylinositol-kinase, and decrease the concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate within the skeletal muscle, indicating direct inhibition of glucose transport/phosphorylation [96].  \n",
      "Exercise acts to interfere with the synthesis of fatty acids at the molecular level. More specifically, exercise, through hormonal and sympathetic nervous system control, promotes the stimulation of cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase. In turn, AMP-activated protein kinase causes the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. Normally, acetyl CoA carboxylase promotes the first step in the synthesis of fatty acids and generates malonyl CoA (the coenzymeA derivitive of malonic acid). Importantly, malonyl CoA is a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, an enzyme required for lipolysis. It has been shown that exercise decreases insulin resistance due to its ability to lower malonyl CoA concentrations within the cell [98]. In effect, therefore, exercise may divert the flow of fatty acids toward mitochondrial oxidation, leading to improved insulin signaling [99]. Furthermore, enhanced fat oxidation through physical activity has been shown to be associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity in obese individuals [85].  \n",
      "Several other molecular and genetic mechanisms have been proposed in the attenuation of insulin resistance due to exercise. Individuals with insulin resistance may have altered gene expression of several enzymes involved in energy homeostasis within the skeletal muscle, including hexokinase II, phosphofructokinase, and glycogen synthase [100]. Decreased muscle glucose transport/phosphorlyation, as indicated by decreased intramuscular concentrations of glucose-6phosphate, has been shown to be lower in the offspring of individuals with type-2 diabetes [101,102]. Furthermore, decreased muscle glycogen synthase mRNA concentrations and decreased activity and activation of muscle glycogen synthase in patients with type-2 diabetes, as well as their insulin-resistant relatives, have been shown [103,104]. A single bout of exercise training has normalized glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in these subjects; however, glycogen synthase activities remained low compared to those of nontype-2 diabetic subjects [105]. In contrast, glycogen synthase activity has been shown to be increased immediately after 60 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling exercise in trained, healthy subjects, and the training effect upon glycogen synthase activity was abolished after 5 days of inactivity [106]. These results suggest differences in glycogen synthase-exercise responses between normal individuals vs. individuals with type-2 diabetes, as well as their offspring, and that increases in glycogen synthase activity may depend upon the duration and frequency of exercise training. In addition, exercise has been shown to affect signaling cascades related to glycogen synthase activity - namely, c-Jun NH2terminal kinase and p38 kinase [107].  \n",
      "In summary, exercise increases insulin sensitivity through a variety of molecular pathways. Several other mechanisms have been proposed that have not been included here. For more detailed information, other resources should be sought [83,86].\n",

      "A distinction should be made between the acute effects of exercise and genuine training effects. However, the acute and persistent effects of exercise on glucose uptake and glycogen metabolism have important implications for individuals with insulin resistance [83], and acute bouts of physical activity can favorably change abnormal blood glucose concentrations and insulin resistance [108]. The time period after exercise is characterized by increased muscle sensitivity to the actions of insulin [86]. A single bout of moderate to strenuous exercise can markedly increase rates of wholebody glucose disposal [109.110] and increase the sensitivity of skeletal muscle glucose uptake to insulin [111.112]. even in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus [70.71]. Up to 2 h after exercise. glucose uptake is, in part, elevated due to insulin-independent mechanisms, probably involving a contraction-induced increase in the amount of GLUT4 associated with the plasma membrane and T-tubules of the skeletal muscles [86].  \n",
      "As reviewed earlier, acute exercise enhances insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and increases muscle GLUT4 protein content, and the depletion of muscle glycogen stores with exercise plays a role in these mechanisms. Due to differences in methodology (including exercise intensity, frequency, and duration), body composition of subjects, and energy homeostasis, it is unclear how long the salutary effects on glucose homeostasis from an acute bout of exercise remain. In addition, insulin sensitivity and/or insulin responsiveness may be different after an acute exercise bout in trained vs. untrained individuals [106]; these effects may be modified by age [21].  \n",
      "Henriksson [21] has reported that insulin sensitivity increases with a single exercise session in the young, but that several training sessions are needed to increase insulin sensitivity in middleaged to older subjects. This researcher also reported that these transient increases in insulin sensitivity disappeared within 3 to 6 days. In moderately trained, healthy men, improved glucose homeostatic mechanisms were observed 12 to 16 h after exercise, but these improvements disappeared within 5 days of inactivity following 5 days of moderate aerobic exercise [113]. In one study, trained subjects were compared with untrained subjects undergoing an acute bout of exercise [106] and trained subjects were compared before and after 5 days of detraining [106]; an increase in maximal insulin action on whole-body glucose uptake (insulin responsiveness) but not insulin sensitivity has been shown to be a long-term adaptation caused by endurance training.  \n",
      "The effects of long-term physical training seem to be beneficial in the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance [114]. During exercise, skeletal muscle utilizes more glucose than when at rest. However, endurance training leads to decreased glucose utilization during submaximal exercise, in spite of a large increase in the total GLUT4 content associated with training. The mechanisms involved in this reduction have not been totally elucidated, but endurance training appears to cause a decrease of the amount of GLUT4 translocated to the plasma membrane by altering the exercise-induced enhancement of glucose transport capacity. Several studies have shown that trained individuals have smaller increases in plasma insulin concentrations in response to a glucose load than do sedentary counterparts and, in spite of this lower insulin response, have unchanged or improved glucose tolerance [86]. Concentrations of amino acids, growth hormone, or catecholamines do not change for these individual which might account for the insulin decrease. Cortisol is decreased days after an acute exercise bout as well as after training, in parallel with the plasma insulin decrease. The cortisol decrease may result in changes in insulin-receptor density in tissues, leading to increased insulin sensitivity. The insulin decrease seems to be due to decreased production (to about two-thirds) and increased clearance (to about one-third) [114].  \n",
      "Training without compensatory increase in caloric intake leads to diminished body fat and increases in lean body mass. However, these changes are not obligatory for the plasma insulin decrease. Even studies that have controlled for these effects detect an improvement in insulin sensitivity due to exercise [86]. Therefore, exercise appears to improve insulin action independently of changes in body composition. Studies have shown improvement in insulin sensitivity with physical exercise despite no changes in body weight [115] or body composition [116] - or even increases in overall body fat [27] - when compared to nonexercising controls [27]. A metaanalytical study reviewed and quantified the effect of exercise on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass in patients with type-2 diabetes [117] and concluded that significant decreases took place in postintervention glycosylated hemoglobin with no differences in body mass between intervention and control groups.  \n",
      "In conclusion, the effects of exercise training could be explained, in part, by the residual effects of the last session of exercise [106], but it could also be explained by long-term up-regulation of the number and function of glucose transporters [118], capillary proliferation [119], and the number of oxidative muscle fibers, which are more insulin responsive [120]. Clearly, there is a combination of several factors whereby acute and long-term exercise can decrease hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Therefore, physical training can be considered to play an important, if not essential, role in the treatment and prevention of insulin insensitivity [121].\n",

      "Studies have shown an increased incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus in relation to abdominal obesity [122]. Increased abdominal adiposity, even despite a normal body weight, is associated with increased cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes risk, in part by the concomitant increases in hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [123–125]. Abdominal fat, or central adiposity, is more metabolically active than peripheral adiposity and may therefore confer greater risk of some diseases than fat deposited elsewhere [76.126]. Furthermore, visceral adipose tissue has been shown to be an independent correlate of glucose disposal in obese postmenopausal women [127] and strongly influences insulin sensitivity in the early postmenopausal period [128].  \n",
      "Exercise has been shown to affect abdominal, or visceral, body fat preferentially [122,129,130]. Several studies have shown that decreased fasting plasma insulin, increases in insulin sensitivity, or a decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through physical exercise is mediated through improvements in adiposity [27], especially central adiposity [131,132]. Previously sedentary overweight or obese postmenopausal women were randomized to a 12-month moderate-intensity exercise intervention (goal: 45 min, 5 days per week) or a stretching control group. Exercise effects on changes in insulin concentrations were modified by changes in total fat mass (p = 0.03, Figure 8.1) [27]. This was primarily because of the exercise effect among women who gained total fat mass; in this group, exercisers had a smaller increase in fasting insulin concentrations than controls (1 vs. 19%, respectively). However, among exercisers, those who lost >2 kg of fat mass had a significantly larger decline in plasma insulin over the year than those who had gained fat mass. Interestingly, in this study exercise effects on changes in insulin concentrations were not modified by changes in intra-abdominal fat.  \n",
      "Wong et al. [133] reported that, for a given BMI, men in the high fitness group had significantly lower waist circumference (p < 0.001), total abdominal fat (p < 0.001), visceral fat (p < 0.001), and abdominal subcutaneous fat (p < 0.001) compared with men in the low fitness group. Other investigators have shown that an increase in physical activity without dietary intervention produced significant decreases in intra-abdominal fat mass [129,134-136] and that improvements in cardiovascular risk factors were related to the loss of centralized body fat rather than to improved fitness [137]. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of exercise and the degree of exerciseinduced weight, fat, and intra-abdominal fat mass loss has been shown in a dose-dependent manner [134].  \n",

      "Table 8.1 presents several randomized controlled trials that include aerobic or endurance exercise interventions vs. control group on the effects of glucose homeostasis in diabetic and nondiabetic participants. Criteria used for this review included evidence-based medicine or best practice in utilizing exercise to attenuate several conditions of glucose intolerance. The table includes the basic study design, the number of subjects (ռ) completing the trial compared to the number of subjects randomized to each group (in parentheses), length of training period, and key outcomes. Studies were included if they were of at least 3 months (90 days) duration, had a sample size of at least 20 subjects, and enabled the assessment of the role of the intervention on insulin action (by an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT], an intravenous glucose tolerance test [IVGTT], or a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp [HEC]). Although improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness measures (VO2 max) are not discussed in detail, it must be noted that exercise promoted improvements in VO2 max independently of losses in body weight [138,139].  \n",
      "Several controlled studies have shown an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in abdominal adiposity with aerobic exercise [130,140–142]. Several of these investigators observed, through subgroup analysis, that the exercise effect on insulin sensitivity or obesity biomarkers such as insulin may be modified by age, loss of body fat, or other potential biological mechanisms. Short et al. [141] evaluated the effects of 16 weeks of aerobic exercise (n = 65) vs. control (n = 37) in men and women (aged 21 to 87) on insulin sensitivity and muscle mitochondria. The exercise program was performed on a stationary bike, initiated with three sessions per week, 20-min duration, and gradually increased to four sessions per week at 80% of maximal heart rate for 40 min. Exercise increased muscle GLUT4 mRNA and protein by 30 to 52% and reduced abdominal fat by 5% and plasma triglycerides by 25%. Insulin sensitivity improved in younger (20 to 39 years) vs. older (≥60 years) participants, suggesting that the insulin sensitivity response to exercise may be modified by age.  \n",
      "Pratley et al. [142] tested effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training on glucosestimulated insulin responses in middle-aged and older individuals over a 9-month period. Subjects were stabilized on the step I American Heart Association diet before training, and calories were increased to prevent weight loss. The aerobic exercise training program included stationary bicycling, walking, and jogging three times per week at an exercise facility with the goal for intensity and duration of 75 to 85% heart rate reserve (HRR) for 30 to 45 min, respectively. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and glucose responses during the oral glucose tolerance test did not change, but insulin response during the oral glucose tolerance test decreased by 16% after training. Training reduced early (0 to10 min) and late (20 to 120 min) phase insulin responses by 14% (p = 0.017 and 0.042, respectively), but did not significantly change glucose disposal (+8%, p = 0.398). The authors concluded that the decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with aerobic exercise training in middle-aged and older men appears to be mediated, at least in part, by reductions in the amount of abdominal fat.  \n",
      "Potteiger et al. [143] examined the insulin and glucose response during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in overweight young adults (age 17 to 35 years) prior to and following exercise training in the Midwest Exercise Trial. Subjects (n = 66) were randomly assigned to nonexercise control (16 females, 13 males) or exercise (22 females, 15 males) groups. The exercise intervention comprised supervised exercise (primarily walking on motor-driven treadmills), 3 to 5 days per week in 20- to 45-min sessions at 60 to 75% of heart rate reserve for 16 months. For glucose area under the curve (determined by the oral glucose tolerance test), no significant differences were found between exercisers or controls across the 16 months of the study. Insulin area under the curve in male exercisers decreased significantly from baseline to 9 months. The authors concluded that regular exercise in healthy, previously sedentary, overweight adult males leads to improvements in VO, max, weight loss and a reduction in the insulin concentration required to dispose of a set  \n",

      "Watkins et al. [144] evaluated the effects of a 6-month intervention involving aerobic exercise training alone (exercise only) or exercise combined with a structured weight loss program (exercise plus weight loss) on coronary heart disease risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Participants exercised three to four times per week for 26 weeks at a level of 70 to 85% of their initial HRR by walking, jogging, or cycling at a supervised facility. Hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose challenge were significantly reduced in the exercise plus weight loss group and the exercise-only group. Participants with the greatest amount of weight loss showed the most robust improvements in abnormal insulin responses. The authors concluded that the addition of a structured weight loss program to an exercise intervention produces a larger degree of improvement in insulin response compared to exercise alone. However, they stressed that although these results reaffirmed the importance of weight loss in improving hyperinsulinemia, weight loss in this study was achieved in the context of an exercise intervention.  \n",
      "Dengel et al. [138] studied the independent and combined effects of aerobic exercise training and weight loss on glucose metabolism in 47 nondiabetic sedentary older men. There were 14 men in a weekly behavioral modification/weight loss program, 10 in a three times per week aerobic exercise program, 14 in an aerobic exercise plus weight loss program, and 9 in the control group. Exercise training consisted of stationary cycling and walking or jogging on a treadmill at an exercise facility with intensity and duration goals of 75 to 85% heart rate reserve for 40 min, respectively. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed significant reductions in insulin responses in all intervention groups, with the decrease in insulin response in the aerobic exercise plus weight loss group significantly greater than that in the other three groups. The glucose area under the curve decreased significantly in the weight loss and in the aerobic exercise plus weight loss groups, but did not change in the control or in the aerobic exercise-alone groups. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal rates, as measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps, increased significantly in the aerobic exercise and aerobic exercise plus weight loss groups; they were significantly greater than those in the weight loss and control groups. These data suggest that aerobic exercise and weight loss improve glucose metabolism through different mechanisms and that the combined intervention of aerobic exercise plus weight loss may be necessary to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in older men.  \n",
      "Despite evidence that exercise appears to improve insulin action independently of changes in body composition, research is ongoing in order to compare the efficacy of diet-induced vs. exerciseinduced improvements in body composition, insulin sensitivity, and other chronic disease risk factors.

      "Ross et al. [140] determined the effects of equivalent diet- or exercise-induced weight loss and exercise without weight loss on subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and insulin sensitivity in obese women. Premenopausal women (n = 54) with abdominal obesity (waist circumference 110.1 ± 5.8 cm and BMI 31.3 ± 2.0 kg/m²) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: diet weight loss (n = 15), exercise weight loss (n = 17), exercise without weight loss (n = 12), and a weight-stable control group (n = 10). Subjects in both exercise groups performed daily exercise (brisk walking, or light jogging on a motorized treadmill) at approximately 80% of their maximal heart rate and in order to expend 500 kcal for the duration of the 14-week trial.  \n",

In comparison with the control group, insulin sensitivity improved within the exercise weight loss group alone (p < 0.001) and, in comparison with controls, cardiorespiratory fitness improved within the exercise groups only (p < 0.01). This study underscores the importance of exercise, even without weight loss, to reduce substantially total fat, abdominal fat, visceral fat, and to improve insulin resistance in obese women.  \n",
      "Ross et al. [130] determined the effects of equivalent diet- or exercise-induced weight loss and exercise without weight loss on subcutaneous fat, visceral fat skeletal muscle mass, and insulin sensitivity in 52 obese men with a mean waist circumference of 110.1 ± 5.8 cm. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four study groups (diet-induced weight loss, exercise-induced weight loss, exercise without weight loss, and control) and were observed for 3 months. The intervention included daily exercise (brisk walking or light jogging on a motorized treadmill) at an intensity of <70% of their initial VO, max or approximately 80% of maximal heart rate for the time it took to expend 700 kcal. Similar reductions in abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, and visceral fat to subcutaneous fat ratios were observed in the weight loss groups. Plasma glucose and insulin values (fasting and oral glucose challenge) did not change in the treatment groups compared with controls. However, the average improvement in glucose disposal was similar in both weight loss groups. Of note is that weight loss induced by increased daily physical activity without caloric restriction substantially reduced obesity (particularly abdominal obesity) and insulin resistance in men.  \n",
      "Katzel et al. [139] compared the effects of weight loss from a hypocaloric diet vs. aerobic exercise training on coronary artery disease risk factors in healthy, sedentary, obese middle-aged and older men. Diet-induced weight loss decreased fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and glucose and insulin areas during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). By contrast, aerobic exercise did not improve fasting glucose or insulin concentrations or glucose responses during the oral glucose tolerance test, but it decreased insulin areas. In an analysis of variance, the decrement in fasting glucose and insulin levels and glucose areas with intervention differed between weight loss and aerobic exercise when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In multiple regression analyses, the improvement in glucose metabolism was related primarily to the reduction in obesity. These authors concluded that weight loss - not aerobic fitness - is the preferred treatment to improve coronary artery disease risk factors in overweight middle-aged and older men.  \n",
      "Hellenius et al. [145] studied 157 normoglycemic healthy men (age range of 35 to 60 years) with moderately elevated cardiovascular risk factors and randomly assigned them to one of four groups: diet advice (n = 40), exercise advice (n = 39), a combination of both (n = 39), and a control group (n = 39). Participants in the exercise group were asked to engage in regular aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, etc.) two to three times per week at an intensity of 60 to 80% of maximal heart rate for a duration of 30 to 45 min. Results showed that the number of pathological oral glucose tolerance tests in the intervention groups decreased from 42/118 to 33/118 compared to no change in the control group. Fasting insulin levels decreased in the exercise and the combined diet + exercise groups (p < 0.01) as well as insulin areas under the oral glucose tolerance test curve. Significant increases in IGFBP-1 were observed for all three intervention groups, especially the combined diet + exercise group (p < 0.001). The marked changes in IGFBP-1 suggested a decrease in insulin secretion and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The researchers concluded that a combination of increased exercise and improved diet, as well as increased exercise alone, improved glucose and insulin homeostasis in middle-aged men with moderately elevated cardiovascular risk factors.  \n",
      "Serum insulin levels have been used as an estimate of insulin sensitivity and a significant independent relationship between hyperinsulinemia and chronic disease risk has been reported from several large epidemiological studies [146-148]. Exercise has been shown to lower insulin concentrations with and without weight loss [27,144,149]. Furthermore, intermittent exercise for 18 months (walking briskly at approximately 50 to 65% heart rate reserve, two times per day, 15 min  \n",
      "per session, 5 days per week) [149] or continuous exercise (≥45 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 5 days per week) for 12 months [127] has been shown to improve serum or plasma insulin concentrations in obese females. However, interestingly, Donnelly et al. [149] showed that intermittent exercise did not affect body weight, percent body fat, and fat mass from baseline to 18 months; however, continuous exercise resulted in significant differences in body weight, total body fat, intra-abdominal fat, and subcutaneous body fat from baseline to 12 months [129]. They suggested that insulin concentrations are affected by intermittent and continuous exercise with or without concomitant weight loss or changes in body composition. Furthermore, short-term (8-week) exercise training in overweight males has been shown to improve insulin resistance [150] by using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score, a surrogate measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity [151,152].  \n",
      "Previously sedentary overweight or obese postmenopausal women randomized to a 12-month study examining the effects of moderate-intensity exercise (n = 87) vs. stretching control (n = 86) showed short-term (3 months) and long-term (12 months) improvements in HOMA scores [27]. Compared with baseline, exercisers had a 7 and 2% decline in HOMA scores, whereas controls had a 10 and 14% increase in HOMA scores, at 3 (p = 0.0024) and 12 months (p = 0.0005), respectively (Figure 8.2). Glycemic control through improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin has also been shown to improve after 12 weeks of walking 1 h per day, 5 days per week in diabetic postmenopausal as well as in normoglycemic postmenopausal women [137]. In conclusion, there appears to be sufficient evidence that aerobic exercise can improve insulin sensitivity as measured by more sophisticated methods (e.g., hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps) or by using less sensitive measures (e.g., HOMA) and/or blood biomarkers (e.g., changes in serum or plasma insulin concentrations).\n",

      "Several limitations are present when reviewing the literature regarding the effects of resistance training on insulin resistance, including small sample sizes, inconsistent protocols, and lack of longer term (e.g., 12-month) studies. For randomized clinical studies that have been published within the last 10 years, four studies used a nonexercising control group [153-156], two compared aerobic training vs. resistance training [155,157], and four observed the effects of aerobic-plusresistance training on insulin sensitivity [153,154,158,159].

      "Although most studies were at least 6 weeks in duration, three studies examined insulin sensitivity after a single bout of resistance exercise [160,165,166]. Chapman et al. [165] examined healthy, postmenopausal women before and after a session of three sets of ten repetitions performed at 50, 75, and 100% of a ten-repetition-maximum for seven different exercises. They found that insulin sensitivity was unaltered by a single session of resistance exercise in postmenopausal women. In contrast, Fluckey et al. [166] showed that a single bout of resistance training (a warmup set of 10 to 12 repetitions followed by a repitition maximum (1-RM) using several Nautilus exercise machines) improved insulin area under the curves in male and female young (mean age 27.1 ± 1.24 years) and type-2 diabetic subjects, but not in older, nondiabetic subjects (mean age 50.7 ± 1.9 years). In agreement with these findings, Fenicchia et al. [160] reported that the glucose area under the curve improved significantly after an acute bout of resistance training (3-RM strength test for eight exercises), but was not improved with chronic resistance training in type-2 diabetic women or age-matched controls. Therefore, several biological mechanisms may modify the effects of insulin sensitivity to a single resistance-training bout, including age or glucose intolerance. More research is needed in order to explain these differences.  \n",
      "Consistent among these studies, however, was the significant increase in strength that accompanied long-term resistance exercise training (>6-week duration) [155,156,158,160-164]. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that improvement in insulin sensitivity was highly correlated with increased muscle mass [167]. Therefore, it is not surprising that resistance training resulted in improvements in insulin action in several [153,155,156,157,161–163], but not all [164], of the previously listed trials.  \n",
      "Comparison of the effects of endurance vs. resistance training on glucose tolerance has been studied [155,157]. Eriksson et al. [157] randomized 14 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance into an aerobic-trained group (three times per week for 6 months; three males, four females) vs. a nonexercising control group (four males, three females) (mean age 60 ± 5 years) and compared the effects on body composition and insulin sensitivity (as measured by an euglycemic clamp) in eight male subjects (mean age 40 ± 3 years) randomized to a progressive circuit-type resistance program (three times per week for 3 months). No significant differences were found between the aerobic-exercise intervention and the control group for any of the parameters assessed. However, a significant (p < 0.05) 23% improvement in total body glucose disposal was observed in the circuittrained group. The authors attributed this improvement in glucose disposal to a 27% (nonsignificant) increase in nonoxidative glucose disposal.  \n",
      "In contrast, Smutok et al. [155] studied 26 untrained men (mean age 54 ± 9 years) with type-2 diabetes (n = 8) or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 12) randomly assigned to a strength-training group (n = 8), aerobic training group (n = 8), or no exercise control group (n = 10) for 20 weeks and found that both intervention groups improved plasma glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test compared to controls. No significant differences in insulin sensitivity between the two intervention groups were found. A 12% reduction (p < 0.05) in total glucose area under the curve was found in the strength-training group compared to a 16% reduction (p < 0.01) in the aerobic-trained group. Fasting insulin levels were reduced in the strength-training group (p < 0.05) but not in the aerobic-trained group. Total insulin area under the curve was decreased by 22% (p < 0.05) following the strength-training program and 21% following the aerobic-trained program. Glucose tolerance was normalized for impaired glucose tolerant subjects following either intervention program; however, subjects with type-2 diabetes did not obtain oral glucose tolerance tests, which fell out of the diagnostic range for diabetes, despite improvements in glucose tolerance.  \n",
      "The effects of endurance and resistance training on insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia have also been studied. Cuff et al. [153] studied 28 obese postmenopausal women with type-2 diabetes randomly assigned to one of three 16-week treatments: control, aerobic only training, or aerobic plus resistance training. Glucose infusion rates increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the  \n",

In addition, the aerobic-plus-resistance training group exhibited a significantly greater increase in muscle density than the aerobic-only training group.

Furthermore, muscle density retained a relationship with glucose disposal after controlling for abdominal adipose tissue.  \n",
      "Wallace et al.

The changes induced by cross-training were significantly greater than those from endurance training alone in percent fat (p < 0.01), insulin concentration (p < 0.05), and glucose levels (p < 0.01).  \n",
      "Ferrara et al. [159] examined the effects of 4 months of resistance exercise to an existing aerobic exercise program (n = 7) compared to a \"maintenance\" aerobic exercise program (n = 8) in overweight, older men. The subjects in this study had recently completed a 6-month aerobic exercise program (treadmill walking, 45 min/day, 2 days/week). The aerobic-plus-resistance trained group added six exercises on upper- and lower-body pneumatic-resistance machines (two sets, 15 repetitions each, 2 days/week) to an aerobic-only exercise program at ≥70% heart rate reserve for 30 to 40 min, 2 days/week on a treadmill. The aerobic-trained group continued the same maintenance treadmill program. No baseline differences in body weight, VO2 max, or glucose metabolism were found between groups. The aerobic-plus-resistance trained group increased upper- and lowerextremity strength (p < 0.05), despite a 9% decrease in VO2 max (p < 0.05); VO2 max did not change in the aerobic-only trained group. The insulin responses decreased by 25 ± 4% in the aerobic-plus-resistance trained group (p < 0.01), but did not change in the aerobic trained only group. However, no changes occurred in fasting glucose or insulin levels or the 3-h glucose responses to an oral glucose load in either group.  \n",
      "These results suggest an additive benefit of resistance training and aerobic training compared to aerobic training alone to improve insulin sensitivity, especially when such training results in loss of abdominal, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue as well as increased muscle density. Poehlman et al. [154] showed that endurance and resistance training improved insulin sensitivity but that, when the glucose disposal rate was expressed per kilogram of fat-free mass, the improved insulin sensitivity persisted in endurance-trained women only. These results suggest that the combined endurance- and resistance-training effect on insulin sensitivity may be modified by gender; however, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.  \n",
      "Resistance training has also been shown to improve markers of glycemic control - namely, glycosylated hemoglobin [168,169] - as well as body composition [170,171]. In addition, 10 weeks of resistance training (n = 8) resulted in significantly lower total body fat (p < 0.05) compared to aerobic training (n = 11) in untrained males. Furthermore, the effect of a 25-week resistance training program (two sets of ten repetitions at 65 to 80% of 1-RM, three times each week) on intra-abdominal adipose tissue in older women and men showed that despite similar decreases in fat mass, women lost significant amounts of intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat compared to men [171]. These results suggest that the resistance-training changes in adiposity may be modified by gender.\n",

      "Although not exhaustive, several studies have examined the effects of diet plus aerobic exercise [85,172-180] or resistance exercise [175,177,180,181] on glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. However, the primary aim of these trials was to induce weight loss and, secondarily, to observe the effects on insulin resistance. Goodpaster et al. [85] showed improvements in insulin sensitivity after combined exercise- and diet-induced weight loss in obese subjects and that the weight loss was likely due to increased fat oxidation during fasting conditions. Exercise training at moderate intensity can induce a higher capacity for, and reliance upon, fat oxidation during the exercise session [182], and chronic effects of exercise, such as increased activity of oxidative enzymes and increased capillary density, facilitate fatty acid utilization at rest and during physical activity [85]. Thus, it is likely that the enhanced fat oxidation during fasting is due to exercise and not caloric restriction. In addition, unlike diet-induced negative energy balance, in which muscle plays a passive role, exercise-induced negative energy balance has been shown to be associated with concomitant muscle consumption of glycogen and triglyceride [183,184].  \n",
      "Several large randomized controlled trials (n ≥ 100) [172,173,185-188] have examined a lifestyle intervention (diet plus exercise) on improving insulin resistance. Most of these studies have shown that insulin resistance was improved in the intervention group, but not independently from changes in weight or body composition. In addition, clinical evidence from multicenter trials has suggested that a lifestyle intervention of diet and increased physical activity can decrease the incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus [189]. Therefore, physical activity should be an adjuvant to diet-induced weight loss strategies and clinicians should stress the importance of exercise in the lifestyle management of chronic disease.\n",

      "Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes mellitus, and several cancers. Cancer research has shown that high levels of plasma insulin as well as insulin-like growth factors can stimulate cell growth and inhibit apoptosis (death of the cell). Physical exercise has been shown to be an important adiunct to the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance because exercise training has been associated with increases in skeletal muscle insulin action and reduction in adipose tissue. Through multifaceted molecular and intracellular systems, exercise can attenuate and abolish increases in insulin concentrations, even in individuals who gain body fat. Complete elucidation of the exercise-induced molecular and intracellular signaling pathways responsible for the amelioration of several chronic diseases will be a worthwhile goal for the improvement of public health. Additional exercise intervention trials in cancer prevention research, with protocol methodologies including validated measures of insulin sensitivity, are recommended to better understand the associations between exercise and insulin resistance.\n",

      "There is mounting evidence that the benefits of physical activity go above and beyond those of weight loss and cardiovascular fitness. Numerous cross-sectional studies and a growing body of exercise intervention studies (the majority of them randomized trials) suggest that habitual physical activity may enhance immune function. In addition to the observed decreased incidence of respiratory infections among moderate-intensity exercisers,1-6 exercise may induce augmentation of immune function through enhanced natural killer cell cytotoxicity, increases in CD4 and CD8 cell counts, and increases in concentrations of circulating antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgM). Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of regular exercise may also protect against other infections, may contribute to enhanced wound healing, and may contribute to the observed decreased incidence of certain types of cancers among physically active individuals.7-10 (See Chapter 4 and Chapter 6.)  \n",
      "Regular physical activity may also be associated with improved cancer prognosis, at least in the early stages of the disease, and reduced mortality rates for certain types of cancers.13 (See Chapter 4 through Chapter 6 and Chapter 24 through Chapter 26.) Although the data are still relatively sparse and inconsistent, the potential immunomodulatory impact of moderate intensity physical activity may have profound public health implications. This review will summarize the findings of a growing body of literature exploring the effects of moderate-intensity exercise on the immune system.\n",

      "Comprising a complex network of organs, tissues, cells, and soluble factors, the immune system guards the body from bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. The immune system is also capable of recognizing and eliminating cells that have become cancerous.11 Many of the components of this multifaceted system have specialized functions; some are designed to elicit a nonspecific (or innate) response, and others produce a specific (or acquired) response.  \n",
      "Major components of the nonspecific immune response include phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which attract, adhere to, engulf, and ingest extracellular pathogens such as bacteria. In addition to nonspecific phagocytosis, macrophages also secrete enzymes, coagulation factors, and several cytokines (regulatory molecules), such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These secreted cytokines induce hepatic transcription factors to upregulate expression of nonspecific acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), which are markers of inflammatory processes.11-14 Natural killer (NK) cells another major component of the nonspecific immune response, lyse cells that have become abnormal or virus infected. The complement system, a complex-triggered enzyme plasma system that coats microbes with molecules and makes them more susceptible to engulfment by phagocytes, is yet another component of the nonspecific immune response; it is the major effector of the humoral (antibody-based) immune response.11  \n",
      "The major components of the specific immune response, T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. T-lymphocytes, which form the basis of acquired immune recognition (cell-mediated immunity), mature in the thymus and secrete cytokines, such as interleukins and interferons, which regulate the complex interactions among lymphocytes and other components of the immune system. These soluble signaling proteins have the potential to influence a variety of downstream parameters of immune function. T-lymphocytes are also capable of attacking other cells directly, through the action of lymphotoxins, which are secreted by cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+) and can induce lysis of infected or abnormal cells. Additionally, lymphokines secreted by helper/inducer T-cells (CD4+) stimulate proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, induce Bcells to produce antibodies, attract neutrophils, and enhance the ability of macrophages to engulf and destroy microbes. B-lymphocvtes primarily function as mediators of humoral immunity via secretion of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins (Ig). Antibodies, each of which has a unique molecular structure corresponding to a specific antigen, bind to and neutralize pathogens so that they may be destroyed by phagocytes. Long-lived memory B-cells are programmed to recognize and respond quickly and efficiently to subsequent invasions by pathogens that have previously been targeted.11  \n",
      "With its complex yet efficient network of interacting components, the immune system has the ability to protect the body from foreign organisms and from cancer development. Research has shown that aging or lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress can inhibit optimal immune response, impeding the immune system from fulfilling its mission.\n",

      "As mentioned earlier, in addition to protecting against bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections, the immune system is also thought to play a role in protecting against carcinogenesis by recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells.11,15 Additionally, immunodeficiency of any origin, whether it is congenital, therapeutic (e.g., following organ transplantation), or acquired via infection, has been observed to increase the risk of certain types of cancer, specifically those etiologically associated with viral infections.15.16 AIDS patients, who have T-cell deficiencies, not only have an increased risk of AIDS-defining malignancies (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma), but also show in cohort studies an increased risk of several types of solid tumors, including lung and, probably, colon cancer. 17,18  \n",
      "Data from a large, population-based cohort study in Japan suggest that differences in immunological host defense - specifically, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity - among apparently healthy individuals may influence stomach, lung, and intestine cancer risk.19 This study followed approximately 3500 adults (mostly older than 40) for 11 years, recorded more than 150 incident cancer cases during follow-up, and found that men in the lowest tertile for natural killer cell activity were at an estimated 40 to 60% increased risk of developing cancer compared to those with medium or high NK cell activity (adjusting for age, relative body weight, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and intake of green vegetables); women in the lowest tertile were at approximately 70 to 90% increased risk (after adjustment for the same confounders).19  \n",
      "Studies have detected elevated levels of CRP in patients with advanced breast cancer and suggest that CRP concentrations increase as the disease progresses to more advanced stages.20-22 Although it is likely that these elevated concentrations merely signal the presence of an inflammatory response to the breast tumor, recent findings by Erlinger and colleagues support the notion of inflammation as an actual risk factor for colorectal cancer.23 Data from their prospective, nested case-control study of a cohort of almost 23,000 adults followed for approximately 11 years indicate that baseline plasma CRP concentrations were significantly higher among those who subsequently developed colorectal cancer compared to controls (median CRP, 2.44 vs. 1.94 mg/L; p = 0.01). These findings suggest that even modestly elevated levels of CRP are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, convincing evidence indicates that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, is associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer and colorectal adenomas, other cancers of the digestive tract, and, possibly, breast or lung cancer.24-34\n",

      "Several in vivo and in vitro techniques have been developed to measure immune function. Many assays have been designed to enumerate specific classes of immune cells or simply to measure the presence of signaling molecules or antibodies; however, several assays have been designed to measure specific cellular functions (e.g., lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell cytotoxicity, or cytotoxic T-cell activity). Determining the clinical significance of \"altered immunity\" as measured by any of the available in vivo or in vitro assays is a challenge.35 Many of the advantages and limitations of the wide variety of immune function assays employed in the literature have been reviewed by Vedhara et al.35 and Mitchell et al.36 and deserve some consideration here.  \n",
      "Enumeration and phenotyping of immune cells by flow cytometry is a commonly employed assay for the measurement of immune function. This technique involves the identification of cell types using color-labeled antibodies that recognize cell type-specific markers. This method has high reproducibility and allows for the comparison of cell ratios and the analysis of cell counts. Enumerative assays may be limited by a lack of correspondence between cell number and cell activity37; however, in combination with functional assays, it is possible to ascertain whether observed alterations in enumerative assays are of functional relevance.  \n",
      "Another method for assaying immune function involves measuring the concentration of circulating cytokines, or cytokines secreted in vitro. As mentioned earlier, cytokines are signaling molecules that regulate the complex interactions among lymphocytes and other components of the immune system; therefore, the concentration of these signaling molecules may mediate the up- or down-regulation of the immune response. Assays have been designed to measure concentrations of a variety of major cytokines, including IL-1, which affects T-cell activation, and IL-2, which is produced by T-helper cells and induces T-cell proliferation. Unfortunately, assessment of serum cytokine levels, although useful for determining the presence or degree of inflammation, does not necessarily provide a good measure of normal function of the immune response due to the usually low concentrations of circulating cytokines detected in the plasma of healthy individuals. Thus, polyclonal mitogen stimulation is a commonly employed technique for measuring cytokine levels produced by proliferating lymphocytes in vitro.  \n",
      "Antibody assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are a simple, robust, and sensitive means of measuring the efficacy of humoral immune response by quantifying the amount of antibody secreted by B-cells following exposure to antigens. However, total antibody levels are a poor indicator of specific antibody response. Therefore, antigen-specific antibody assays, which may have greater clinical relevance, are preferred over measurement of total antibody levels, which may obscure true relationships between physical activity and a specific antibody response.  \n",
      "Assays that target cell function such as proliferation or cytotoxicity, may provide a more meaningful assessment of immune function. Lymphocyte proliferation occurs naturally in the presence of pathogens and serves to increase the number of immune cells available to fight an infection. The effectiveness of T-lymphocyte proliferation can be measured in vitro by culturing Tcells in the presence of common mitogens or specific antigens, although this method does not always accurately reflect the in vivo response of the cells.  \n",
      "Cytotoxicity assays (for T-cells and NK cells) assess the cytotoxic potential of cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells critical in the defense against infections and tumors. These assays measure the ability to lyse target tumor cells in vitro.26,38 However, these techniques cannot identify the mechanism associated with observed reduced cytotoxicity. For example, cytotoxicity may be impaired due to a variety of defects in the immune response, including: antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, defects in the release or function of perforin (a protein secreted by cytotoxic cells that causes lysis of target cells on contact), or decreased proliferation of effector cells. Additionally, in most cases, it is not possible to attribute the cytotoxic effects exclusively to natural killer cells or other lymphocyte subsets. Although the mechanisms underlying potential deficiencies cannot be readily delineated, the interplay of multiple cell types does more accurately reflect in vivo immune function. 35,36,39  \n",
      "Because each of these techniques for measuring immune function has advantages and limitations, 35,36 most studies rely on a combination of assays to assess immune function.\n",

      "The past decade has seen tremendous growth in published epidemiological data in the field of exercise immunology. For example, evidence now supports the proposed J-shaped dose-response relationship that has been used to describe the effects of varying intensities of physical activity on immune function.40-42 At one end of the spectrum, athletes under tremendous physical stress during periods of intense training or competitions are more susceptible to some illnesses (e.g., upper respiratory tract infections).42 At the same time, accumulating evidence suggests that regular moderate exercise can reduce susceptibility to illnesses such as the common cold.1-6,42 This and other advances in our understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of regular moderate-intensity physical activity will be discussed later.  \n",
      "Strengths and limitations of the various epidemiological study designs employed to explore the associations between a variety of measures of immune function and regular physical activity have been summarized in Table 9.1.

NK cell cytotoxicity was also assessed for a subset of the elderly participants (n = 19: mean age. 65 years) in a 6-month randomized-controlled trial conducted by Woods and colleagues and was found to be nonsignificantly higher (p < 0.10) among those randomized to the exercise intervention compared to stretchers in the control group.51 It is possible that the size of the subset selected for this assay was simply too small to detect any statistically significant intervention effects. Another small randomized study among 50 mildly obese women (intervention group mean age, 36 years; control group mean age, 33 years), of whom only 36 completed the 3month trial, detected significantly increased NK cell cytotoxicity 6 weeks into the intervention, but not at week 15.1  \n",
      "Although the data are not conclusive, most evidence from randomized-controlled trials to date suggests that exercise has no statistically significant effect on NK cell cytotoxicity. However, the assigned exercise interventions may have been too shortin duration (generally 10 to 15 weeks) to show effects. Certainly, the implications for enhanced NK cell function associated with habitual moderate intensity physical activity would be profound, especially in light of findings from epidemiological studies, which noted increased cancer incidence with depressed natural killer cell cytotoxicity .19  \n",
      "Similarly, most evidence from randomized-controlled trials (Table 9.3) suggests that moderateintensity exercise has no statistically significant effect on lymphocyte proliferation.3.44.50-56 Details of two of these studies with null findings, conducted by Nieman et al. and Fahlman et al., have been described earlier in this chapter.3,50 Mitchell et al. assessed lymphocyte proliferation in 21 male college students (intervention group mean age, 23 years; control group mean age, 20 years) who completed a 12-week randomized exercise intervention, consisting of 30 minutes on a stationary bike three times per week, at 75% of their VO, peak.33 It is possible that this study was unable to detect any significant exercise effects because young people generally have better immune function regardless of exercise tendencies.  \n",
      "Woods et al. randomized 33 otherwise healthy elderly individuals (mean age, 65 years) to 15 to 40 minutes of supervised brisk walking or stretching three times per week.31 For the 29 subjects who completed the 6-month intervention, no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte proliferation was observed, despite a significant (p < 0.05) increase in VO, max among the exercisers. In fact, both groups exhibited increased lymphocyte proliferation, which was somewhat, though nonsignificantly, greater among the exercisers. A large (n = 50) randomized-controlled study among mildly obese women also found no statistically significant effect of exercise on lymphocyte proliferation22; however, this study did suffer from a 28% dropout rate, which could have biased the results. A small (n = 18) 8-week randomized-controlled trial among middle-aged individuals with rheumatoid arthritis also reported no statistically significant effect.44  \n",
      "Finally, in the large four-arm exercise and diet study conducted by Nieman et al.

      "Concentrations of markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), are often elevated among overweight or obese individuals — an association most likely related to the upstream role of adipose tissue-secreted cytokines (e.g., IL-6) in the production of these acute phase proteins. In fact, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A have been associated with body fatness01-70 and sedentary lifestyles61,69,71-81 in cross-sectional survevs. Despite a strong suggestion of an association between lower concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A. IL-6, and TNF-α with increasing level of physical activity observed in these cross-sectional studies (Table 9.2), the best designed intervention studies actually support the absence of a significant association between exercise and these markers of inflammation (Table 9.3).  \n",
      "For example, three large, well-designed randomized-controlled trials have yielded results indicating that physical activity interventions have no significant effect on serum concentrations of CRP.58,88,89 Specifically, de Jong and colleagues were unable to detect a significant association between C-reactive protein levels and exercise intervention among 217 frail elderly individuals (mean age, 78 years) randomized to an exercise intervention (strength, endurance, coordination, and flexibility training), micronutrient-supplemented diet, exercise and diet, or control group.58 Although only 145 subjects completed the 17-week intervention, the authors indicate that the high (24%) dropout rate was mainly due to health problems (frequent among this study population of frail elderly individuals) and not related to the assigned intervention.  \n",
      "In a more recent four-armed randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of exercise, diet-induced weight loss, or the combination of exercise and diet-induced weight loss on markers of inflammation. Nicklas and colleagues also found that exercise had no significant effect on circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein among the 252 older (mean age, 69 years), obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis who completed the 18-month trial.88 Although this study had only 80% retention, the authors report that concentrations of inflammatory markers from the baseline blood draws were not statistically significantly different for subjects who completed, dropped out, or failed to provide follow-up blood samples. They suggested that individuals for whom change in concentration of inflammatory markers could not be assessed were similar to those who completed the 18 months, with respect to baseline inflammatory markers.  \n",
      "Additionally, Rauramaa et al. conducted an impressive 6-year randomized-controlled study, in which 140 middle-aged men (mean age, 57 years) were randomized to exercise (walking, jogging, swimming, and/or cycling) for 30 to 60 minutes, three to five times per week.99 The C-reactive protein concentrations of the 125 men who completed the study were analyzed on an intent-totreat basis. At the end of the 6-year intervention, circulating C-reactive protein levels were lower among those randomized to exercise; however, despite the large sample size, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.2). Finally, a small 8-week randomized trial similarly found no significant effect on C-reactive protein among rheumatoid arthritis patients randomized to bicycle training four to five times per week at 80% of the subjects' VO2 max.44  \n",
      "Of the four intervention studies that reported a decrease in C-reactive protein levels associated with physical activity, three were nonrandomized®-92 (one of which also lacked a nonexercise control group®9). The one randomized study to date that has reported a decrease in C-reactive protein associated with an intervention was primarily focused on weight loss through a low-energy Mediterranean-style diet among 120 obese premenopausal women.93 Participants randomized to the intervention arm also received information about the importance of physical activity, mainly through walking, and attended monthly or bimonthly sessions with an exercise trainer. No structured exercise regimen was established for participants randomized to the intervention arm in this study, and evidence of change in physical activity level in study subjects was assessed only through selfreport. Nonetheless, women randomized to the intervention group reportedly increased from 64 to 175 minutes of physical activity per week, compared to women in the control group who increased from 71 to only 102 minutes per week (p = 0.009). At the end of the 24-month trial, women randomized to the intervention had experienced significant reductions in BMI and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, although the effect of the modest exercise aspect of the intervention of this randomized-controlled trial could not be isolated from that of the effects of the diet-induced weight loss.  \n",
      "Likewise, the majority of findings from studies investigating the effects of exercise on levels of IL-6, a precursor in the production of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, are similarly most convincing for no effect,44,83-89,90 with a handful of studies reporting a significant decrease. 84,86,93 Interestingly, Adamopoulos et al. observed a significant decrease in IL-6 among exercisers with chronic heart failure, but not among healthy exercisers.84 Gielen et al. observed a significant decrease in IL-6 expression in local skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) but no effect on serum concentrations of the proinflammatory molecule. 66 Finally, while some studies have also shown that consistent exercise significantly lowers levels of other cytokines implicated in the production of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α, 82-84,86,166 others have not. 44,84-88\n",

      "Perhaps the most convincing line of evidence suggesting that regular, moderate-intensity physical activity has positive immunomodulatory effects can be seen with respect to incidence or duration of upper respiratory tract infections.134 Specifically, in two 12-week randomized studies, Nieman and colleagues demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among elderly women (mean age, 73 years) randomized to walking compared to those randomized to calisthenics3 and significantly fewer upper respiratory tract infections symptomatic days among female exercisers (mean age, 46 years) compared to nonexercisers.4 Unfortunately, assessing the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections as a clinical manifestation of immune function may be limited by differential self-reporting of events among exercisers compared to nonexercisers.\n",

      "Document 189:\n",
      "From the large body of exercise immunology literature that has accumulated, it is difficult to distill a single take-home message regarding the effects of regular moderate-intensity exercise on immune function. The benefits of physical activity may in fact go above and beyond those of weight loss and cardiovascular fitness: however, the inconsistencies in existing data make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the immunomodulatory effects of exercise.  \n",
      "Many factors may have contributed to some of the seemingly contradictory findings summarized earlier, including  \n",
      "- Widely diverse study populations\n",
      "- The type, intensity, duration, and frequency of the exercise prescribed •\n",
      "- Incorporation of unmonitored exercise sessions in conjunction with supervised training sessions\n",
      "- The lack of a \"true\" nonexercise control group in some instances (or any control group, for many studies)\n",
      "- Lack of baseline samples\n",
      "- Varying time of sample collection  \n",
      "Additionally, for many of the intervention studies, small sample sizes (frequently less than ten subjects per trial arm), in conjunction with the wide variability inherent in most measures of immune function, limited the ability to detect significant associations when, in fact, they may have existed and potentially contributed to the increased risk of biased or chance findings. In many instances, we cannot be sure whether the null findings truly reflect the absence of an intervention effect or whether the studies are simply too underpowered to detect even modest effects that may still be clinically significant. It is also important to acknowledge that studies with null or contrary findings may have a lower likelihood of publication (this may be an issue in particular with observational studies).  \n",
      "Associations that were detected cross-sectionally (Table 9.2) in many instances are not apparent in the randomized data (Table 9.3). In the observational studies, physically active individuals likely differed from their sedentary counterparts by more than just the amount of time they devoted to exercise each week; other health habits associated with physical activity, such as use of nutritional supplements, may have confounded the observed associations. Furthermore, the observational studies may reflect the impact of a lifelong pattern of physical activity, whereas the intervention studies can usually measure only the impact of several months of activity. It is possible that longterm moderate exercise training is needed to reveal a positive impact of physical activity on immune function measures.  \n",
      "Determining the clinical relevance of the in vitro measures of immune function is another challenge inherent in the exploration of this scientific question. Due to the complex nature of the immune system, quantifying the absolute impact that physical activity might have on an individual's overall immune function is a difficult task. In vitro measures of immune function, the endpoint considered in the majority of the studies reviewed in this chapter, may only have limited clinical relevance. Thus, although a great deal of the in vitro measures were not significantly associated with physical activity, perhaps we should focus our attention on the convincing evidence suggesting that incidence and intensity of upper respiratory tract infections, which are clinical manifestations of immune function, can be modulated with exercise interventions.  \n",
      "Despite a large quantity of null findings, a suggestion that regular moderate-intensity physical activity is beneficial for host immune defense persists, mostly with respect to markers of inflammation and incidence of respiratory tract infections. It is imperative that additional large, wellconducted, randomized-controlled exercise intervention studies are undertaken to further substantiate that claim. These studies should combine the measurement of in vitro immune function markers and relevant clinical outcomes.\n",

      "As reviewed in Chapter 5, despite the imperfect measurement of physical activity, results of epidemiological studies indicate that a higher activity level is associated with a 50% reduction in risk of colon cancer [1,2]. These results are consistent across various populations, study designs (prospective and retrospective), and types of activities (leisure and occupational). Perhaps the only debatable issue is whether strenuous and nonstrenuous activities are equally protective. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms of action responsible for the association between higher physical activity and lower risk of colon cancer.  \n",
      "Proposed biological mechanisms for the effect of physical activity on colon carcinogenesis include a decrease in bowel transit time, alteration of immune function, decreased bile acid metabolism, and insulin resistance [3-6]. Alternatively, given the evidence linking higher prostaglandin production (particularly of the E series) to the development of colorectal cancer, it is plausible that physical activity may protect against colon cancer through its effect on mucosal prostaglandin levels.\n",

      "Prostaglandins are the primary cellular metabolites from the action of the cyclooxygenases on arachidonic acid and exert various physiological actions in the gastrointestinal tract, including maintenance of mucosal integrity, regulation of secretion, and motility [7]. Previous research has suggested that prostaglandins play a role in the development of colon cancer given that tumor cells produce higher amounts of prostaglandins than normal cells. Increased prostaglandin production, particularly of the E series, has been reported in colonic tumor cells in humans and in experimental models [8-11]. It has also been shown that individuals with colorectal polyps or cancer have higher levels of colonic mucosal prostaglandin (PG)E2 than control individuals do [12].  \n",
      "The mechanism by which prostaglandins contribute to colon carcinogenesis remains uncertain. Prostaglandins may modulate the development of colorectal neoplasia through the stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation [13] or the inhibition of apoptosis [14]. Furthermore, prostaglandins are known to regulate growth and spread of tumors [15,16]. It is also possible that the effect of prostaglandins is mediated by nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), which have been shown to alter colon carcinogenesis [17-19]. Because PGI, has been found to act as a ligand for PPARδ [20], and PPARy is activated by fatty acids and other arachidonic acid metabolites, it is possible that prostaglandins alter colon carcinogenesis through this receptor.  \n",
      "Support for the role of prostaglandins on colorectal neoplasia is derived from animal and human studies in which aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis - reduce risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas [21]. The biological mechanism is thought to be through the effect of these agents on arachidonic acid metabolism by inhibiting cycooxygenases, key enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid [22]. At least two isoforms of cycooxygenase (prostaglandin synthetase, COX) exist in humans. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues. Conversely, COX-2 is induced by agents such as cytokines and growth factors. However, whether COX-2 directly modulates the function of tumor cells is still unclear, so it is possible that prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are responsible for tumor promotion.\n",

      "Given the consistent epidemiological findings for the protective effect of physical activity on colon cancer, as well as the strong link between prostaglandin synthesis and colorectal neoplasia, an observational cross-sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that physical activity mediates colon cancer risk through its effect on PGE, synthesis [23]. Analyses were conducted among 41 men and 22 women, 42 to 78 years of age and with a history of polyps, who participated in a clinical trial testing the effects of piroxicam on rectal mucosal PGE, levels. Only nonusers of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications were eligible for the trial. A study schema is shown in Figure 10.1.  \n",
      "For the cross-sectional studies, PGE, concentration was measured in rectal mucosal biopsies collected during the run-in period at visits one and two prior to randomization. A self-administered questionnaire collected at baseline was used to assess leisure-time activity and to calculate a commonly used energy expenditure score (MET-hours per week) from the activities reported. Results showed that a higher level of leisure-time physical activity was significantly inversely related to PGE2 concentration in rectal mucosa (p < 0.03). Based on the results of the statistical  \n",
      "FIGURE 10.1 Piroxicam study schema. Biopsies (Bx) 1 and 2 were used for cross-sectional study and biopsies 3, 4, and 5 were used for prospective study (placebo group only).  \n",
      "model, an increase in activity level from 5.2 to 27.7 MET-hours/week was associated with a 28% decrease in levels of PGE2. This change in activity is approximately equal to 1 hour of walking or 30 minutes of jogging or other aerobic exercise per day. The results were consistent when total time per week spent in leisure-time activities was used instead of MET-hours/week, further strengthening the findings.  \n",
      "In addition, a positive association between body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity, and PGE2 levels was shown (p < 0.001). In this setting, it is possible that BMI is merely a marker for physical activity because active individuals tend to be leaner than inactive ones [23]. However, when physical activity and BMI were included in the same statistical model, the results for each variable were unchanged, suggesting an independent effect of each factor on PGE2 levels.  \n",
      "Our published study comprised cross-sectional analyses, so it was not possible to assess temporality of the association. Therefore prospective analyses of these data were conducted after the trial results were published. Because of the beneficial effects of the piroxicam intervention on PGE2 levels [24], analyses were limited to the control group (n = 29). As shown in Figure 10.1, three biopsy samples were taken after randomization. As was done in the cross-sectional analyses, PGE2 concentration at the three time points was modeled using a maximum-likelihood repeated measures model. Results of these analyses showed that a higher level of leisure-time physical activity was significantly inversely related to PGE2 concentration (p < 0.01), indicating that an increase in activity level from 5.2 to 27.7 MET-hours/week was associated with an 18% decrease in levels of PGE2. Although a positive association between BMI and PGE2 was observed, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.17). The prospective data support the cross-sectional analyses, indicating that higher physical activity levels are significantly associated with lower PGE, concentrations in rectal mucosa.  \n",
      "The overall significance of rectal mucosal PGE2 to colorectal cancer risk is unknown; no evidence to date directly links rectal mucosal PGE2 levels to the development of colon cancer development. Furthermore, although one study showed that PGE, levels in the upper rectum are correlated with those in the remainder of the colon [12], this requires further study. Nonetheless, given the current knowledge of increased prostaglandin production in human colonic tumor cells, these data support the potential for PGE2 playing a role in the protective mechanism of physical activity on risk of colon cancer. Whether this is a direct role of prostaglandins is unknown.  \n",
      "It is also possible that this effect is linked to production of insulin or the regulation of insulinlike growth factors because it has been shown that prostaglandins of the E series are capable of stimulating insulin secretion [25,26] and that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis is regulated by PGE2 as well as other agents that stimulate cAMP [27-29]. Also, as noted earlier, the study population comprised nonusers of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; therefore, it is not known whether these findings are applicable to users of these drugs.  \n",
      "It was hoped that these findings would stimulate further work in this area. However, to our knowledge, these results have not been replicated. At least one intervention study testing the effect of exercise on colon and rectal cell markers, including prostaglandins, has been conducted - the APPEAL (A Program Promoting Exercise and an Active Lifestyle) Study [2]. Details of this study are found in Chapter 12. Briefly, 102 men and 100 women were randomized to an intervention or a control group. The intervention comprised a 1-year period of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise intervention, with a goal of 60 minutes per day, 6 days per week. Adherence to this intensive program was excellent, with 85% of participants meeting 80% or more of their goals. The control group was given the opportunity to participant in exercise classes for 2 months at the end of the 1-year period. Final results pertaining to the PGE2 findings are expected to be available in 2006.  \n",
      "Strenuous exercise has been shown to produce acute increase in prostaglandin levels [30], including PGE2 [31]. In a study involving trained runners, participants were placed on 15, 30, or 40% energy from fat for 4 weeks [32] and were exposed to running to exhaustion at 80% of their VO2 max in the last week of the dietary regimen. A series of markers, including PGE, were measured in plasma before and after the run. It was hypothesized that a low-fat diet would result in higher PGE, prior to and after the endurance run compared to the high-fat diets.  \n",
      "Results of the study showed that pre-exercise plasma PGE, levels of participants in the 40% diet were significantly lower than those in the lower fat diets. Furthermore, PGE, levels were significantly higher after the endurance run compared to levels before the run among all participants, regardless of dietary regimen; thus, fat intake had no effect on the plasma postexercise PGE, levels. Furthermore, the postexercise PGE2 level was significantly lower on the 40% fat diet compared to the 15% diet, which led the investigators to conclude that dietary fat helps reduce stress caused by exercise and has few adverse effects in well-trained athletes. The overall relevance of these acute responses in prostaglandin concentrations to risk of colorectal cancer, however, is unknown.\n",

      "Document 196:\n",
      "In conclusion, the results of a single cross-sectional study show a significant reduction in rectal mucosal PGE, concentration associated with a higher level of leisure-time physical activity and a lower BMI. Furthermore, follow-up prospective analyses of this study also support the inverse association between physical activity and PGE, levels. To our knowledge, these findings have not been replicated; however, results of the APPEAL intervention study should provide stronger evidence for the direct effect of physical activity on a variety of markers in rectal mucosa, including prostaglandins.  \n",
      "As can be appreciated, much work is needed in this important area of colon cancer prevention research. Studies linking levels of PGE, and other prostanoids in various tissues, including rectal mucosa, to the development of colorectal cancer are needed to validate these biomarkers. If they are successful, concentrations of these markers could be used to assess biologically plausible mechanistic effects of various lifestyle factors. Furthermore, these surrogate biomarkers can be useful to assess drug dosage and compliance in prevention trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and other agents, including those such as the APPEAL study, whose mechanism of action is exerted via prostaglandins.\n",

      "Studies of the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis have used a variety of animal models, including chemically induced tumors, transplantable tumors, spontaneous tumor models, and transgenic and induced-mutant mice, in addition to experimental metastasis models [1]. Many of the studies have identified some form of protective effect of voluntary or involuntary exercise on carcinogenesis, although more recent studies have been less consistent (reviewed in Shephard and Futcher [2] and Woods [3]). To the detriment of the field, the number of studies has not increased dramatically over the years and, perhaps more importantly, few studies have really focused on potential mechanisms that might explain the exercise effects.  \n",
      "Mechanisms most commonly cited as potential mediators include enhanced antioxidant defense, reductions in body fat, decreases in reproductive hormones, enhanced immunity, or a change in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its related binding proteins, some of which could be acting through similar pathways (Figure 11.1). There are also site-specific mechanisms for various cancers, such as a decreased colonic transit time in relation to colon cancer. Many of the mechanisms that have received more attention in humans (e.g., estrogen, IGF-1) have not received much focus in exercised animal models and vice versa (e.g., immunity in animal models). Some of the more intriguing proposed mechanisms will be examined here.  \n",

      "Animal models have the benefit of a short time for the development of cancer, so training the animal until the development of the disease is feasible. Unfortunately, few studies that have used a training approach have also examined potential mechanisms within that same study or model. Therefore, evidence for the potential mechanisms, as with studies in humans, largely comes from a synthesis of data from studies in which exercise training's effects on biomarkers or potential risk factors are examined separately from studies looking at the association between the marker or mediator and a cancer endpoint. When examined in this fashion, the strength of the association between exercise and the mechanistic factor, as well as that between the mechanistic factor and disease, is important (Figure 11.2).  \n",
      "The evidence to be addressed in this review will focus largely on the first types of studies, if available (option A), and then on studies that have looked at associations between exercise and the potential mediator (option B). We will largely not consider the strength of the evidence for associations between the mediator and the cancer outcome. An additional caveat to this review is  \n",
      "FIGURE 11.2 Conceptual framework for how a mechanism can be evaluated. In option A, which is currently limited to animal models, one can examine mechanisms in the context of a cancer endpoint. In option B, which can use animal, human, or cell culture experiments, the links between exercise and the mediator, and the mediator and the cancer outcome, are examined independently. The strength of the proposed mechanism depends on both relationships in this type of approach.  \n",
      "that effects of chronic exercise training will be considered rather than the effects of acute bouts of exercise.

      "Reactive oxygen species can play a significant role in carcinogenesis via their ability to produce DNA damage as well as damage to other cellular components that interact with DNA [4]. The idea that endogenous sources of these reactive oxygen species may play a bigger role in carcinogenesis than exogenous sources (e.g., environmental carcinogens) is particularly relevant to exercise research because the increased metabolism associated with acute exercise can be a significant source of free radical generation [4.5]. Fortunately, the body has a battery of antioxidant enzymes as well as nonenzymatic repair systems that work to prevent and/or repair the damage induced by reactive oxygen species, and chronic exercise training may be an important stimulus to upregulate these systems [5-7].  \n",
      "To date, few studies have examined reactive oxygen species-related damage or relevant antioxidant enzymes in the context of exercise in a cancer model. One study has examined wheel running in a tumor-bearing rat model and its effects on coenzymes Q and Q10 in skeletal muscle because exercise in this same model had been found to delay cancer-induced cachexia [8]. Both enzymes appeared to be upregulated in anterior tibialis muscle, and O., also in the soleus. We have just completed our first studies of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and the 8-epiprostaglandin F20 (8-PGF20) isoprostane in a transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer and have found largely unchanged values. The exception is a decrease in excreted 8-PGF2α in wheelrun compared to sedentary mice coupled with no effect of the wheel running on tumor-specific survival (unpublished data).  \n",
      "Exercise studies to date have largely focused on tissues relevant to exercise (e.g., skeletal muscle, heart) and not necessarily those tissues relevant to common human cancers (e.g., mammary. colon, lung). One group, however, examined antioxidant defense mechanisms in relevant tissues following a 10-week treadmill training program in rats; they found that superoxide dismutase and catalase were upregulated with exercise in the lung, and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase was upregulated in liver and lung [9]. Radak et al. also reported a decrease in reactive oxygen species production in the liver following 8 weeks of treadmill training in Fischer 344 rats [10].  \n",
      "Given the wide array of relevant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; relevant nonenzymatic proteins such as the heat shock proteins and hemoxygenase-1; the various techniques and measures used to evaluate antioxidant status and/or DNA damage; and the variety of animal models and exercise protocols, it will clearly be difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding this factor as an anticancer mechanism for exercise until many more studies have been conducted. Despite this, evidence is accumulating to suggest that chronic exercise training promotes beneficial effects in many animal antioxidant systems [6].\n",

      "One frequently cited mechanism for the association between activity and cancer prevention in humans is a decrease in body weight or obesity as a result of exercise, which would subsequently work through further \"downstream\" targets such as estrogen metabolism, inflammation, or insulin sensitivity. In animals, calorie restriction has long been known to have sigmificant effects on body size and carcinogenesis [11]. Consequently, a reasonable hypothesis is that loss of body mass through exercise might also result in a reduction or delay in carcinogenesis. Few studies have actually examined body composition; however, body weights have frequently been recorded with training. Whether weight loss and/or body fat reductions are achieved can depend largely on the training protocol used, diet consumed, and the animal model and sex of the animal used. Table 11.1 is a summary of studies addressing the effects of exercise in various cancer models in which body weight and/or composition was also assessed. Mammary tumor studies have dominated the literature in this area, with the majority of studies cited using chemically induced carcinogenesis.  \n",
      "Only one group to date has used voluntary wheel running in mammary models; in each of the studies, all the animals were placed on high-fat diets (20 to 23%) [12-14]. In the studies using 1methyl 1-nitrosurea (MNU) in F344 rats, body weight in the exercised animals was increased compared to that of sedentary rats [12,13]; however, in a study of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) in Sprague-Dawley rats, the voluntary exercise resulted in lower body weights [14]. In all three studies, the trend was for lower body fat with the exercise. Despite the differences in body weight, the exercise beneficially affected carcinogenesis in all of the studies. Time to tumor formation was delayed in both models, adenocarcinoma incidence was decreased in the MNUtreated F344 rats [12,13], and total tumor number was decreased in the DMBA-treated Sprague-Dawley rats [14].  \n",
      "Among the studies using treadmill exercise, results are quite variable concerning the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis as well as on body weight and composition. Increases in body weight with treadmill exercise have led to increased incidence of tumors [15,16]. In one of these studies, in which a high-fat diet was given, body fat was increased with the exercise [15]; however, in the other study, body fat was not different from that of the sedentary rats [16]. Studies in which exercise had no effect on body weight have had varied results: decreased tumor multiplicity or incidence [17,18], no effect on tumor incidence or multiplicity [19-21], increase in the tumor growth rate [20], or decrease in the tumor growth rate [21]. Perhaps the most important point to be derived from a review of these studies is that no consistent relationship between the effects of exercise on body weight/composition and its effect on carcinogenesis has been found.  \n",
      "In terms of intestinal cancers in rodents, Thorling et al. found that a substantial volume of exercise resulted in lower body weight and body fat along with a decreased incidence of adenomas, but not carcinomas [22]. Reddy et al., on the other hand, saw no effect of voluntary wheel running on body weight in rats, but a significant decreased incidence of colonic adenocarcinomas, but not adenomas [23]. We have looked at polyp development following treadmill exercise in the Min mouse, an induced mutant mouse in which an APC tumor suppressor gene mutation results in multiple intestinal polyps [24]. In ad libitum fed animals, body weights were unchanged by exercise, and polyp development was not significantly affected [25].  \n",
      "In a follow-up experiment, exercised mice were pair-fed with the sedentary control mice in order to produce a negative energy balance due solely to the exercise. Body weights in the exercised mice were significantly lower in the last few weeks of the study compared to control mice, and body fat was significantly lower in female exercised mice compared to female controls [26]. Despite the negative energy balance, total polyp number was not affected in males or females by exercise, and there was only a suggestion of a decrease in jejunal polyps with exercise in the male mice. Therefore, although limited in number, studies of exercise effects on intestinal tumors have not been consistent in regard to body weight or fatness as a mediating effect of exercise.  \n",
      "So far, the data on body weight with exercise in pancreatic cancer models suggest that this factor may be somewhat important. In the three studies identified to date, exercise appeared ineffective in only one of the studies, which also showed a lack of change in body weight [27]. For liver cancer models, however, all three identified studies found that exercise decreased tumor incidence or burden [28-30], with a decrease in body weight only found in one study [30].  \n",
      "To date, the various models of exercise and carcinogenesis suggest that the negative energy balance created by exercise is not a likely mechanism of cancer prevention in these animals, with the possible exception of pancreatic cancer. This is consistent with studies of caloric restriction and exercise effects on aging. Holloszy demonstrated that, although voluntary exercise in Long-Evans rats increased average lifespan, it did not increase maximal lifespan as calorie restric-  \n",

      "tion did [31]. Additionally, the combination of exercise and calorie restriction extended lifespan to the same degree that calorie restriction alone did. Holloszy concluded that those results, as well as results from a prior study [32], suggested that caloric restriction acts, at least on aging, through some other consequence of caloric restriction aside from the energy deficit that it creates.  \n",
      "A recent statistical analysis of caloric restriction on longevity in Wistar rats concluded that changes in body weight could only account for ~1 1% of the effects of caloric restriction on longevity [33]. Similarly, it is quite possible that the effects of exercise on carcinogenesis are largely independent of its effects on energy balance. Unfortunately, the limited evidence to date in animal models of exercise is not yet conclusive; few studies have attempted to control both sides of the energy balance equation. Additionally, many of the studies of mammary cancer have used young animals, which may not be relevant as models of the exercise effects in postmenopausal women because mice and rats cease cycling around ~12 and ~19 months of age, respectively [34]. Clearly, more studies are needed in which energy expenditure and energy intake are manipulated in young and older animals to examine the resultant outcomes definitively in terms of body weight, body composition, and carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Changes in steroid hormone levels - estrogen and testosterone in particular - are perhaps the most consistently cited potential mechanism for the association of physical activity with breast and prostate cancer. Relatively few studies have been conducted in rodents, perhaps due to the difficulties in measuring these hormones at specific times in the considerably shorter reproductive cvcle in rodents, which averages ~4 to 6 days [34]. Nonetheless, results suggest that, in younger rodents, exercise training must be of a considerable volume and/or intensity in order to disrupt regular cycling and estrogen levels.  \n",
      "A 12-week treadmill training program in 8-week-old Harlan Sprague–Dawley rats resulted in lower estradiol levels and an anestrous state in 5 of 16 exercised animals compared to no changes in the 16 sedentary rats [35]. Through this progressive training protocol, animals were running 4 h/day, 7 days/week, at 30 to 38 m/min, up a 10 to 15% grade by the end of the program. It cannot be discerned, in this case, whether the disruptions were a result of the volume of training or its intensity, although the ad libitum fed exercised animals did not differ in weight at the end of the protocol compared to the controls. Eight weeks of 5 days/week, 2.5-h swims combined with access to running wheels resulted in a decrease in estradiol levels and disruption of regular cycling in CDstrain rats; this was accompanied by lower body weights as well as weights of the ovarian fat pads [36].  \n",
      "In contrast, 8 weeks of a more moderate exercise training did not alter body weight or estradiol levels in 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats [37], although mesenteric and subcutaneous levels of body fat were lower in the trained vs. untrained rats [38]. Similarly, a 12-week moderate treadmill training program in 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats had no effect on estradiol or progesterone [39]. This latter study is the only one to examine hormones in the context of a model used to study exercise effects on tumorigenesis. This same treadmill training program was repeated in a separate study in which rats of the same age received low or high doses of the carcinogen MNU [40]. Although exercise had no effect on tumor-free survival time, incidence, or tumor multiplicity, it did result in lower tumor weights and growth rates.  \n",
      "Results are not as consistent in older or ovariectomized animals. Moderate treadmill training for 8 weeks in 26-week-old Wistar rats resulted in significantly lower estradiol and progesterone levels [41]. Body weights also appeared lower vs. control animals, although the significance of the difference was not reported. In ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats of the same age and exercised in a similar training program to the previous study, the training had no effect on estradiol levels or body weight [37]. Voluntary wheel running for 3 weeks had no effect on body weight or estrogen  \n",
      "in 8-month-old B6DF1 mice [42], but increased progesterone in 2-month-old ovariectomized mice of the same strain [43].  \n",
      "One primate study was identified that was consistent with the suggestion of a high training volume necessary for disturbance of the reproductive hormones. Adult cytomolgous monkeys were progressively trained on a treadmill until they were running approximately 12 km/day (2 h/day), 7 days/week [44]. All eight of the exercised monkeys became amenorrheic but none of the eight control monkeys did. The time to develop the amenorrhea varied considerably, with a range of 7 to 24 months. Lutenizing hormone and progesterone were lower during the amenorrhea as well as during the month preceding it; estradiol was only significantly lower during the amenorthea. Surprisingly, despite this large volume of running, the body weights of the monkeys were reported not to change, although food intake was reported to remain constant.  \n",
      "Collectively, these studies appear reasonably consistent in demonstrating a need for high volumes or intensities of activity in order to disrupt luteal function. Although body weights were reported, few attempts were made to disentangle the effects of exercise from those of energy balance in general. This has been shown to be important in humans, in whom it appears that negative energy balance and not physical activity per se can alter reproductive hormones in young women [45].  \n",
      "One of the mechanisms suggested for the potentially decreased risk of prostate cancer with activity is a reduction in testosterone levels. To date, no studies of exercise in an animal model of prostate cancer have been published. In rodent models in general, evidence is quite inconsistent in terms of exercise effects on testosterone levels. With varying exercise training protocols and rodent species, basal testosterone levels have been found to increase [46,47], decrease [48], or remain unchanged after the training program; however, the changes may depend on how many weeks into the training the hormone is assayed [49].\n",

      "Along with body composition and energy balance, immune function has been the area most studied in relation to the potential affects of exercise on cancer outcomes. Most tumor-related models to date have looked at immunity in models of metastasis or implanted tumors. This review will focus on studies that have examined immunity in the context of a cancer model or immunity to cancer cells in vitro. Excellent reviews have already been produced on the effects of acute and chronic exercise on potentially relevant immune markers such as natural killer cells, other lymphocytes, and macrophages [50.51].  \n",
      "Several studies have examined exercise effects on immune function in the context of implanted tumors. In only one case did moderate exercise training reduce the growth of the tumor and, in this case, the survival of the rats [52]. Lymphocyte proliferative responses were also increased in the trained rats. In other studies, final tumor weights or volumes were unaffected by the various exercise regimens despite increases in various immune functions such as splenocyte mitogen response and phagocytic activity of macrophages [53-55]. One study examined the growth and regression of allogeneic EL-4 lymphoma cells and found that repeated strenuous exercise delayed the time to peak tumor volume and resulted in a quicker regression of the tumor [55]. This latter study found fewer inflammatory cells within the tumors as well as a decrease in angiogenesis [55].  \n",
      "Many studies have examined exercise effects on experimental tumor metastasis models in association with innate immune cell activity. An acute bout of exhaustive exercise and 6 days of hour-long bouts of higher intensity exercise have been found to decrease the number of lung tumor foci following intravenous injection of B16 melanoma cells [56.57]. In both studies, the same exercise was found to increase macrophage cytotoxicity against the same tumor in vitro. Additionally, studies with other models of exercise have found that chronic and short-term repeated bouts of acute exercise can increase macrophage antitumoral cytotoxicity in vitro [58-60]. Collectively, the studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of many types of exercise on macrophage function and, in the two cases examined, on experimental lung tumor metastasis.  \n",
      "Studies looking at natural killer cell activity in relation to tumor retention have been less consistent in terms of the tumor outcome relating to the in vitro cell function. Several studies have identified a beneficial effect of exercise training on splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity [61,62] or on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity [63]. Additionally, tumor cell retention in the lungs following intravenous injection - considered by some to be a marker of natural killer cell activity - has frequently been found to be reduced with exercise training [61,62], although this effect may depend on the aggressiveness of the tumor used in the assay [64].  \n",
      "Unfortunately, these apparently beneficial effects on immunity have not translated into a reduction in lung tumor metastasis [62-65]. These results may not agree for a number of reasons, including differences in the tumor cell lines, the comparison of splenic natural killer activity to metastasis at another organ site, or the assumption that lung retention of tumors is a marker of natural killer activity. It is more likely, however, that any effect of exercise on the complex process of lung tumor metastasis will likely involve more than one immune cell as well as other processes not directly related to innate immune cell cytotoxicity, such as cell adhesion, inflammation, and angiogenesis.  \n",
      "Nonetheless, the data in animals are promising in the sense that exercise of many types and intensities appears to have beneficial effects on innate immunity that may be important in cancer prevention. Prior studies have primarily used transplanted tumors and intravenous injection of tumor cells as a model of metastasis. What are needed are more studies of exercise training-induced changes in immunity in the context of different cancer models including spontaneous, chemically induced, or genetically modified carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Within the past several years, insulin-like growth factor-1 and its related binding proteins have received considerable attention as potential mediators of the protective effects of physical activity on cancer incidence. Although the evidence that IGF-1 is relevant to carcinogenesis is convincing (reviewed in Yu and Rohan [66] and Kaaks and Lukanova [67]), the link between physical activity and IGF-1 is quite inconsistent and, in the case of animals, quite limited. One group has nicely demonstrated with liver-specific IGF-1-deficient transgenic mice that circulating IGF-1 is important in colon and mammary carcinogenesis [68,69]. Additionally, another group has shown in various models that a decrease in circulating IGF-1 mediates, in part, the effect of caloric restriction on carcinogenesis [70].  \n",
      "It is overly simplistic to assume that because caloric restriction and exercise can result in a negative energy balance, exercise may also act on carcinogenesis via a lowering of IGF-1. In fact, given that IGF-1 functions in protein synthesis and is associated with the development of lean mass [71,72], one would expect that IGF-1 might be increased early in exercise training in order to increase lean mass. Unfortunately, the variety of exercise protocols, heterogeneity of subjects, and timing and type of IGF-1 measurements have resulted in an unclear association even in humans [73]. As previously mentioned, data in animals are much more limited, particularly in regard to exercise training and circulating IGF-1.  \n",
      "In a model of carcinogen-induced pancreatic cancer, Syrian hamsters with access to running wheels had IGF-1 levels that were no different than those of controls at three time points across the experiment [27]. In this study, insulin levels were also examined and found to be lower in the exercised mice that were also on a high-fat (25%) corn-oil diet compared to their high-fat diet controls. Neither in high- or low-fat (5%) fed animals, however, did the wheel running affect the incidence or multiplicity of tumors. This is consistent with a study we have recently completed that examined moderate- and vigorous-intensity treadmill running as well as wheel running in a transgenic mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis. We measured IGF-1 at two to three timepoints during the study and found no differences in IGF-1 by group (unpublished data). Similar to the pancreatic cancer study, no beneficial effect of the exercise on tumor outcomes was found. In the  \n",
      "In one other study, rats were run on a treadmill with and without added weight for 5 weeks to examine the effect on various bone growth factors. No difference was found between the exercise and control conditions on circulating IGF-1 measured at the end of the 5 weeks [74]. Collectively, these experiments suggest that exercise training does not appear to affect basal levels of IGF-1 in various rodent models, although clearly the evidence in this area is limited.\n",

      "Proliferation, apoptosis, and structure of organs can all determine susceptibility to and/or the progression of cancer. It was hypothesized in the late 1980s that total cell number and cellular proliferation could be risk factors for cancer; some of the underlying evidence was the increased cancer risk associated with body weight and height and the decreased risk with calorie restriction [75]. Indeed, the balance between cellular proliferation and programmed cell death, or apoptosis, plays a role in the carcinogenic process [76]. In terms of breast cancer, in particular, mammographic density, which is indicative of the relative amount of stroma and epithelium compared to fat tissue in the breast, is considered an important marker of breast cancer risk [77].  \n",
      "Westerlind et al. proposed that the beneficial effects of exercise on mammary carcinogenesis in rats may be to alter the glands during the critical window between sexual maturity and first pregnancy [39]. In particular, the study examined the terminal end buds that are the mammary structures most susceptible to carcinogens [78]. Moderate exercise training begun at 28 days of age in Sprague-Dawley rats had no effect on body weight or growth, age at sexual maturation (average age = 36 days), or the number of terminal end buds. Cellular proliferation in the mammary gland, as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry, was higher at 42 through 70 days of age in the exercising animals. Apoptosis, assessed by counting apoptotic cells in stained gland sections, was also higher in the exercised rats at 70 days of age and, nonsignificantly, at 84 days of age.  \n",
      "In a similar study, 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent moderate treadmill exercise training until 50 days of age, at which time some were sacrificed for the examination of mammary development and proliferation. The rest received a 50-mg/kg dose of NMU and were followed for 24 more weeks [18]. The exercise training did not alter body weight, mammary gland development, or cellular proliferation. Although exercise did not affect tumor incidence, it did result in a reduction in total tumor number as well as the number of tumors per rat. In a repeat experiment with a lower dose of NMU (37.5 mg/kg), exercise still did not affect incidence, no longer had an effect on tumor multiplicity, and actually increased the growth rate of the tumors [20].\n",

Although body size and fatness have received the most attention, the evidence is largely unsupportive of an energy balance-mediated reduction in cancer risk with exercise. One possible exception is pancreatic cancer, although only three studies have evaluated this. Rodent studies suggest an enhancement of antioxidant defense systems with chronic, moderate training, although few studies have looked at tissues that may be most relevant to carcinogenesis.  \n",
      "Similar to the findings in studies in younger women, it appears that high-volume or highintensity exercise training is necessary to lower estrogen levels in animals or to disrupt cycling. It is not completely clear whether these effects are due to a reduction in total energy reserves or to  \n",
      "the exercise. Innate immunity appears to be enhanced with exercise training in rodent models; however, frequently, this enhanced immunity has not coincided with a reduction in tumor burden or metastasis. There is very little evidence to date to evaluate the potential role of IGF-1 in the exercise and cancer relationship. Finally, studies have not found an influence on mammary gland development, which could be relevant to breast cancer, although it appears that some changes with cellular proliferation take place.\n",

      "As described in Chapter 4 through Chapter 6, epidemiological studies have shown that increased physical activity is associated with decreased risk for several cancers. Yet, the amount, type, and intensity of physical activity needed are unknown. Furthermore, the effect of an increase in activity levels in previously sedentary persons is unknown. Finally, the mechanisms through which exercise might reduce cancer risk are unproven in humans.  \n",
      "Intervention studies can help to answer some of these open questions in cancer prevention [1]. Through intervention studies, researchers can test the effect of one or more specific exercise prescriptions on disease biomarkers or disease. In monitored interventions (e.g., in a study facility with supervising staff), the researcher can be assured that the individual actually performed the exercise, and the length and intensity of the exercise can be accurately measured. It is easier to control the effects of confounding factors such as other health behaviors in intervention studies, which makes such studies a useful addition to other human research such as epidemiological observational studies.  \n",
      "With intervention studies, researchers can assess the effect of increase in exercise on risk factors for cancer; this is very difficult to assess in observational studies because the population trend is for people to decrease physical activity over time rather than to increase it. Furthermore, intervention studies designed to study cancer risks can include exercise programs that are likely to be most relevant to cancer, such as aerobic exercise and colon cancer risk, conditioning for cancer patients, etc. Selected populations, such as persons at high risk for cancer, of different age groups, or of different racial or ethnic backgrounds, can be studied to determine exercise effects on the biology in different settings.  \n",
      "Finally, intervention studies can focus on cancer patients and survivors, whose physical abilities and needs are different from most other patient and healthy population groups. Such intervention studies can focus on rehabilitation for such individuals, biological effects relevant to survival, or both.  \n",
      "This chapter reviews the exercise intervention studies that have been designed and conducted to focus on cancer prevention-related endpoints. It does not include the trials conducted in cancer patients - those will be covered in Chapter 25 through Chapter 28. A number of trials have been focused on exercise effects on endpoints related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or aging. These are not covered in depth in this chapter, but may be included in other chapters dealing with specific factors such as exercise effect on insulin or sex hormones.\n",

      "Exercise intervention studies related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases have a rich history; however, very few such studies related to cancer have been conducted. Intervention studies focused on cancer can concentrate on the exercise type, dose, and frequency most relevant to cancer. These studies can focus on persons at high risk for cancer (e.g., those with a family history of cancer, a personal history of benign precursors, particular genetic polymorphisms, etc.). Exercise intervention studies can assess exercise effects on biological endpoints most relevant to cancer etiology and prevention.  \n",
      "This is not to dismiss the important knowledge that can be gained from intervention studies originally focused on other diseases. For example, several studies point to etiological roles for insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and their binding proteins, and risk for cancer. Many exercise intervention studies have addressed the effects of various types of exercise on insulin levels in various age, gender, race/ethnic, and other demographic groups. A smaller number of studies have assessed exercise effects on various IGFs and their binding proteins (IGFBPs). The information from these studies can be applied to the cancer prevention field, although studies will still be needed to confirm these associations in persons at elevated risk for cancer and in persons who already have a diagnosis of cancer.\n",

      "Several studies have looked at exercise training effects on ovulatory and menstrual patterns in girls and young women [2-5]. Some [3,4] but not all [2] of these studies have found that exercise increases menstrual cycle length, suppresses ovulation, and lowers estrogen and progesterone levels. One found that weight loss was necessary to cause changes in reproductive factors in young women [5]. These reproductive effects are relevant to etiology of several cancers — most notably breast and endometrium - because lowered numbers of ovulatory menstrual cycles and lowered levels of estrogen are associated with lower risk of developing these cancers.  \n",
      "Several clinical trials have assessed exercise effects on insulin as a biomarker of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in relation to exercise [6]. Other trials have assessed the effect of exercise interventions on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 as possible mechanisms linking exercise effects on the aging process with variable results [7-10]. One recently published randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of a 10-month strength-training program on IGF and IGFBP in 54 women aged 30 to 50 years and found that, after 15 weeks, the subjects randomized to the strength-training program experienced a decrease in IGF-1 of -30.47 ng/mL vs. an increase of 5.86 ng/mL in controls (p = 0.02) [10]. After 10 months, IGF-1 returned to baseline levels in the treatment group, but remained 15% lower in treatment compared to control participants. The study found no effect of the strengthtraining program on IGFBP-1 and -3.  \n",
      "A 6-month endurance exercise trial in 21 older women did not change IGF-1 concentrations in exercisers when compared with controls [11]. A small trial found that an 8-week endurance exercise program produced a small, nonsignificant increase in IGF-1 concentrations in older women [12]. As summarized in an excellent review by Orenstein and Friedenreich, little evidence of an effect of exercise on insulin-like growth factors has been found [13].  \n",
      "There is a growing literature of small intervention studies that have assessed the effect of exercise on immune function [14,15], with varied effects. The role of immune function in cancer etiology is unclear, but certainly several cancers have immune components, including lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical cancer, and other cancers caused by infectious agents. The effect of exercise on immune function and inflammatory markers is covered in depth in Chapter 9.\n",

      "The Physical Activity for Total Health Study design has been described in detail elsewhere (A. McTiernan, Principal Investigator) [16]. The aims of the study were to examine, in postmenopausal women, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise on: serum sex hormones (estrogens, androgens, sex hormone binding globulin); metabolic hormones (insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3); weight and adipose tissue stores: and immune function. The study was a randomized controlled clinical trial testing a 12-month moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention. Exercise participants were asked to exercise for at least 45 minutes per session, 5 days per week. The intervention was a combination of facility-based and home-based exercise. During the first 3 months, participants came three times per week to a study facility where they exercised in small groups using treadmills and stationary bicycles. They also exercised 2 days per week on their own, doing exercise of their choosing. The control participants met weekly for a 1-hour nonaerobic stretching class.  \n",
      "To be eligible for the study, women needed to be postmenopausal, between the ages of 50 and 75 years, and in good health (no serious chronic disease such as cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc.). They had to be overweight (body mass index [BMI] of 25 kg/m² or more, or BMI between 24.0 and 24.9 with percent body fat greater than 33%). Women had to be sedentary (no more than 60 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or greater exercise). They could not be taking hormone replacement therapy in the past 3 months. They had to be nonsmokers and consume less than two alcohol drinks per day on average. Women were recruited to the study by a variety of methods, including mass mailings and media, as described in detail elsewhere [17].  \n",
      "Primary study data were collected at study baseline, and at 3 and 12 months. We used several methods to measure and monitor adherence to the exercise intervention, including facility class attendance, daily activity logs, heart rate monitors, physical activity questionnaires, pedometers, and fitness testing (VO, max treadmill tests).  \n",
      "A total of 173 women were randomized, and exercise and control groups were virtually identical at baseline for age, body mass index, education, and other demographic variables. Adherence and retention were excellent. Only three women refused their 12-month endpoint collection, and six women dropped the exercise intervention (all after 3 months). We therefore had complete outcome data for 3 months and nearly complete for 12 months. Exercisers on average increased their VO, max by 12.7%; controls increased by just 0.8% (p < 0.0001 for exercise vs. control change from baseline to 12 months) [18]. Women randomized to the exercise group (n = 87) participated in moderate-intensity sports/recreational physical activity on 3.7 ± 1.4 days/week (79% of the prescribed 5 days/week) for 171 ± 88 minutes/week (87% of the prescribed 225 minutes/week) over the yearlong trial period [19]. Of the exercisers, 68% had a yearlong average physical activity level exceeding the national recommendation of 150 minutes/week.  \n",

      "Compared with controls, exercisers experienced significant declines in adiposity, including weight, BMI, percent body fat measured by DEXA scan, and intra-abdominal fat measured by abdominal CT scan [21]. We found that the exercise intervention resulted in a significant decrease in estradiol, estrone, and free estradiol from baseline to 3 months, with an attenuation of effect at 12 months [18]. Among women who lost body fat, however, the exercise intervention resulted in statistically significant reductions in these estrogens at both time points. Similarly, among women who lost body fat, testosterone and free testosterone decreased significantly more in exercisers than in controls [20]. Urinary estrogen metabolites did not change with the exercise intervention, however [22], nor did IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 [24].  \n",
      "We found that some markers of quality of life change with exercise. Women who exercised in the morning, for example, had improved sleep quality compared with night-time exercisers, and women who were assigned to a stretching control group also experienced improvements in sleep [27]. The prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms, on the other hand, were little changed by exercise [26].  \n",
      "Additional exploratory analyses have provided intriguing information regarding the genetic control of weight and its association with sex hormones. For example, we found that exercisers carrying the CYP19 (the gene controlling aromatase activity) 8r allele had a smaller decrease than did noncarriers in percent fat (-0.3 vs. - 1.5%, respectively, p = 0.05) [28]. Exercisers with two vs. no CYP19 11r alleles had a larger decrease in BMI (-1.0 vs. 0.1 kg/m², respectively, p = 0.02), total fat (-3.0 vs. -0.4 kg, respectively, p =0.01), and percent body fat (-2.4 vs. -0.5%, respectively, p < 0.001). Additional analyses are under way to assess the role of genetic polymorphisms on exercise effect on cancer biomarkers.\n",

      "The APPEAL (A Program Promoting Exercise and an Active Lifestyle) Study is testing the effect of a moderate intensity exercise program on colon and rectal cell proliferation, apoptosis, and prostaglandins in men and women (A. McTiernan, Principal Investigator). Other study endpoints include metabolic hormones (insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3), weight, and adipose tissue stores (percent body fat measured via DEXA scan, intra-abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal fat measured by one-slice CT scan).  \n",
      "The APPEAL study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 102 men and 100 women between the ages of 40 and 75 years were randomized. To be eligible, men and women must have had a colonoscopy within the previous 3 years. The sample is over-representative of persons with a history of adenomatous colon polyps (a colon cancer precursor) and persons with a first-degree family history of colorectal cancer (which increases risk for colon cancer). Participants must also have been physically inactive (engaging in less than 60 minutes per week of moderate- or vigorousintensity exercise), drink less than two alcohol drinks per day, nondiabetic, and with no personal history of invasive cancer.  \n",
      "Participants were recruited to the APPEAL study through several methods. The primary recruitment method was through gastroenterologists' practices, in which persons who had had a colonoscopy in the past 3 years were identified and sent an invitation letter from their physician with an enclosed Interest Survey to complete and return. Additional recruitment methods included media placements, flyers, a study website, and referrals.  \n",
      "From the 9828 letters mailed to gastroenterology practice patients, 2033 (21%) responded with interest in joining the study and, of these, 956 (47%) were potentially eligible. These 956 persons were interviewed by phone regarding eligibility requirements and 240 (25%) were preliminarily eligible. In addition, 1328 calls were made to the study line in response to media placements, of which 1092 interviews were completed and 107 were preliminarily eligible. The major reasons for ineligibility were because a respondent was not interested in being randomly assigned to exercise or control groups, was too physically active, or did not have time available to attend classes (such as working excessive hours). After extensive screening, 102 men and 100 women were enrolled in the trial and randomized to exercise or control (delayed exercise).  \n",
      "The intervention was a 1-year, moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise program. The goal was 60 minutes per day, 6 days per week. The intervention included both gym-based and home-based exercise programs. Participants met in classes to exercise with an exercise specialist in attendance 3 days per week. Four facilities were available to participants (one located at the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center Prevention Center, A. McTiernan, director) and three private health clubs (participant membership paid by the study).  \n",
      "At the facilities, participants performed aerobic exercise for 45 minutes per session on machines (primarily treadmills and stationary bikes, supplemented with rowing machines and elliptical machines). They also performed some limited weight-training exercises, which were personalized according to the participants' needs and interests. (If they chose to do weight training, it was in addition to the 60-minute aerobic exercise session.) Warm-up, cool-down, and stretching exercise completed the exercise sessions.  \n",
      "Participants also were asked to exercise at home 3 days per week. Some of the study facilities provided the opportunity for participants to work out during any open hours, so some participants did their home exercise as unsupervised gym workouts using various machines. Other participants chose outdoor walking or jogging as their primary home exercise. An additional part of the intervention was a series of monthly behavior change classes in which participants met individually or in a group with an exercise physiologist trained in behavior change techniques. In these meetings, participants discussed issues and challenges to exercise adherence and came up with strategies to overcome challenges.  \n",
      "Several strategies were used to increase and maintain adherence to the exercise program. The exercise specialists met individually with participants every month to review progress and to address any particular adherence problems with that participant. Graphs showing study goals and individual performance were shared with the participant, and discrepancies between the two were discussed. Participant adherence was monitored by the study staff and principal investigator (PI) weekly through automated reports from weekly downloads of participants' daily exercise log data (data were entered weekly). Participants with adherence problems were discussed in depth, and strategies for improvement were discussed. Quarterly newsletters were sent to participants with tips on exercise and news on study progress. Small incentives were included, such as giving participants pedometers or water bottles after certain goals were met. Finally, group activities such as hikes and snowshoeing were arranged.  \n",
      "Several methods were used to measure and monitor adherence, including facility class attendance (entered on facility logs), home exercise logs, quarterly total physical activity questionnaires, VO, max treadmill tests (baseline and 12 months), and pedometers recording daily steps (done quarterly for 1 week).  \n",
      "Adherence to the program was excellent, with 80% of participants meeting 80% or more of their goal of 360 exercise minutes per week. On average, the participants met 91% of their goal minutes per week of exercise. Only seven individuals (two men and five women) dropped out of the exercise program. The control group was given the opportunity to participate in exercise classes for 2 months (with the same progression as that offered to the exercise-arm participants during months 1 and 2 of intervention) at the end of the 1-year period.  \n",
      "Analyses of study specimens for proliferation, apoptosis, and prostaglandins are under way. Final primary results should be available in 2005. Several ancillary studies are in place or under consideration, including an ongoing study to assess the effect of exercise on subjective and objective sleep measures, a study measuring exercise effect on proteomics, a study of exercise effect on mammogram density in women, and a study of exercise effect on testosterone and other sex hormones in men. In addition, blood and biopsy specimens are being stored for potential future uses.\n",

Future exercise intervention studies should test different types of exercise, various intensities of exercise, different frequencies of activity, and intermittent vs. continuous exercise effects. Different populations and age groups should be studied because the effects of exercise may vary by age, gender, race, ethnicity, geography, and culture. Persons at varying risks of developing cancer should be studied because exercise may have different types and magnitudes of effects in persons at high vs. low risk of cancer. Finally, novel biomarkers of cancer risk should be studied.  \n",
      "The clinical trials and other intervention studies reviewed in this chapter make the assumption that the biomarker endpoints lie in the causal pathway between physical activity and cancer development. If, in fact, the pathways diverge, then assessing the exercise effect on such biomarkers will give an inaccurate picture of the physical activity-cancer picture. The optimal study would be a large-scale randomized clinical trial testing the effect of exercise on disease endpoints, such as that being done to test the effect of a low-fat dietary pattern on incidence of breast cancer [6]. Such a trial would be expensive and time-consuming, but could be done more efficiently if several disease endpoints were studied (e.g., cardiovascular, diabetes, etc.), and its results would have great public health implications.\n",

These hormones include estrogens, androgens, SHBG, insulin, IGF, and IGFBP. Future advances in this area can be made as novel hormonal cancer biomarkers are identified. A small number of past and ongoing exercise intervention studies suggest that exercise can improve immune function (as reviewed in Chapter 9), which could in part explain the exercise-cancer association.  \n",

      "The favorable effects of endurance training and physically active lifestyle on the risk of several chronic diseases and their risk factors have been well documented. As presented elsewhere in the book, regular physical activity seems to protect also against several types of cancer. The effects of exercise training and regular physical activity are usually reported and interpreted in terms of group means and these trends are then generalized in the whole population. However, over the last two decades, it has become evident that there are marked interindividual differences in the adaptation to exercise training, even when the exercise stimulus is identical across the subjects. Consequently, a concept of individualized exercise prescription has gained popularity. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concept of interindividual differences in the adaptation to exercise, summarize the contribution of genetic factors to the person to-person variability, and review the available data regarding the genotype-physical activity interactions on cancer.\n",

      "As evidenced by several consensus meetings and expert panel recommendations [1-5], the body of scientific evidence regarding physical activity and sedentarism and their effects on risk factors, health outcomes and mortality rates is already impressive and is growing. However, the effects of exercise and physical activity have been almost always tested and reported in terms of main effects and mean group differences. Consequently, the interpretations and conclusions have been based on the average effects observed in groups of subjects. Although means and main effects are effective and convenient ways to summarize large amounts of data, it tends to be forgotten that not all members of the group follow the pattern reflected by the group mean. In fact, considerable individual  \n",
      "differences are present in the risk factor responses to regular physical activity, even when all subjects are exposed to the same volume of exercise, adjusted for their tolerance levels [6].  \n",
      "The concept of heterogeneity in responsiveness to standardized exercise programs was first introduced in the early 1980s [7]. In a series of carefully controlled and standardized exercise training studies in young and healthy volunteers, it was shown that the individual differences in training-induced changes in several physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes are large, with low and high responders showing 8- to 13-fold differences [7-11]. The most extensive data on the individual differences in trainability come from the HERITAGE Family Study, in which 742 healthy, but sedentary, subjects followed a highly standardized, well-controlled endurancetraining program for 20 weeks. The average increase in maximal oxygen consumption (VO, max), a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, was 384 mL O, with an SD of 202. However, the training responses varied from no change to increases of more than 1000 mL O, per minute [6,12].  \n",
      "A similar pattern of variation in training responses was observed for several other phenotypes, such as plasma lipid levels and submaximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure [6,13,14]. For example, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured during steady-state submaximal (50 W) exercise decreased on average by 7 and 3.5 mmHg, respectively, in response to exercise training [14]. However, the responses varied from marked decreases (systolic blood pressure > 25 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 12 mmHg) to no changes or, in some cases, even to slight increases [6,14].  \n",
      "This kind of variation is an example of normal biological diversity, is observed in most populations, is generally beyond measurement error, and is potentially very informative in terms of the adaptive mechanisms involved [6,15]. However, only now are the factors contributing to these interindividual differences beginning to be understood.\n",

      "Document 227:\n",
      "The available studies on the interindividual differences in adaptation to regular physical activity have shown that the phenomenon is independent of age, sex, and ethnic background of the subjects [6.8]. The contribution of the pretraining levels of the response phenotype seems to vary depending on the trait. For example, in the HERITAGE Family Study cohort, baseline VO, max and HDL cholesterol levels explained only about 1% of the variance in the respective training responses. On the other hand, contribution of the pretraining values was much greater for the training-induced changes in submaximal exercise blood pressure, heart rate, and stroke volume, with R-values ranging from 30 to 40% [6].  \n",
      "A common feature for most of the training response phenotypes is that they show significant familial aggregation, i.e., individuals within the same family tend to be more alike in terms of trait values than those from different families. Familial aggregation and maximal heritability of a trait, i.e., the combined effect of genes and shared environment on a phenotype, can be estimated using data from family and twin studies. The heritability estimates are based on comparisons of phenotypic similarities between pairs of relatives with different level of biological relatedness. For example, biological siblings, who share about 50% of their genes identical by descent, should be phenotypically more similar than their parents (biologically unrelated individuals) if genetic factors contribute to the trait of interest. Likewise, a greater phenotypic resemblance between identical twins (100% of genes identical by descent) than between dizygotic twins (50% of genes identical by descent) indicates genetic effect on the phenotype.  \n",
      "In pairs of monozygotic twins, the between-identical-twin-pairs variance in response to regular exercise has been reported to be from two to nine times larger than the within-pairs variance for cardiorespiratory fitness, hemodynamic, and metabolic phenotypes [9.16.17]. Thus, gains in absolute VQ4 max were much more heterogeneous between pairs of twins than within pairs of twins. In the HERITAGE Family Study, the increase in VO2 max in 481 individuals from 99 two-generation families of Caucasian descent showed 2.6 times more variance between families than within families. Maximum likelihood estimation of familial correlations (spouse, four parent-offspring, and three sibling correlations) revealed a maximal heritability estimate of 47% [18].  \n",
      "In addition to VO, max, the heritability of training-induced changes in several other phenotypes, such as submaximal aerobic performance [19]; resting and submaximal exercise blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output [20-23]; body composition and body fat distribution [24,25]; and plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels [26], have been investigated in the HERITAGE Family Study. The maximal heritabilities for these traits ranged from 25 to 55% further confirming the contribution of familial factors to the person-to-person variation in responsiveness to endurance training.\n",

      "The evidence from the genetic enidemiology studies suggests that a genetically determined component affects exercise-related phenotypes. However, because these traits are complex and multifactorial in nature, the search for genes and mutations responsible for the genetic regulation must not only target several families of phenotypes, but also consider the phenotypes in the sedentary state and in response to exercise training.  \n",
      "It is also obvious that the research on molecular genetics of exercise-related phenotypes is still in its infancy. For example, the 2003 update of the Human Gene Map for Performance and Health-Related Fitness phenotypes map included 109 gene entries and quantitative trait loci on the autosomes and two on the X chromosome for physical performance (cardiorespiratory endurance. elite endurance athlete status, muscle strength, other muscle performance traits, and exercise intolerance) and health-related fitness (hemodynamic traits, anthropometry, and body composition; insulin and glucose metabolism; blood lipids and lipoproteins; and hemostatic factors) phenotypes [27]. As a comparison, the latest version of a similar map for obesity-related phenotypes included more than 330 loci [28].  \n",
      "These numbers demonstrate that relatively little has been accomplished to date. For instance, no gene contributing to human variation in endurance performance has been identified yet as a result of studies based on model organisms. Now that the era in which large fractions of the human, mouse, and rat genomic sequences are available is here, the field of exercise science and sports medicine will need to devote more attention to molecular and genetic research.\n",

      "The majority of the exercise-related molecular genetic studies published so far have utilized a candidate gene approach, i.e., a gene has been targeted based on its potential physiological and metabolic relevance to the trait of interest. Statistical tests for an association are based on the comparison of allele and genotype frequencies of genetic markers between two groups of subjects: one with the phenotype of interest (e.g., high VO2 max or endurance athletes - i.e., the \"cases\") and the other one without (the \"controls\"). However, with continuous traits, the test is done by comparing mean phenotypic values across genotype groups or between carriers and noncarriers of a specific allele.  \n",
      "The genetic data hold great promise to help in understanding why some individuals respond favorably to exercise training in terms of reduction of chronic disease risk factor levels and others do not. The major problem of the candidate gene association studies with multifactorial traits is the lack of repeatability of the positive findings across different populations. For example, in the 2003 update of the Human Performance and Health-Related Fitness Gene Map, all the genes associated with body composition, plasma lipid, and hemostatic phenotype training responses were based on a single study [27].  \n",
      "However, with hemodynamic phenotypes, some candidate gene findings have been replicated in at least two studies. For example, an association between blood pressure training response and the angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T polymorphism has been reported in the HERITAGE Family Study and the DNASCO study [29,30]. In white HERITAGE males, the angiotensinogen M235M homozygotes showed the greatest reduction in submaximal exercise diastolic blood pressure following a 20-week endurance training program [29]. In middle-aged Eastern Finnish men, the M235M homozygotes had the most favorable changes in resting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure during a 6-year exercise intervention trial [30].  \n",
      "Similarly, an association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and training-induced left ventricular growth has been reported in two studies [31,32]. In 1997, Montgomery and coworkers reported that the ACE D-allele is associated with greater increases in left ventricular mass, and septal and posterior wall thickness after 10 weeks of physical training in British Army recruits [32]. In 2001, the same group reported a new study using a similar training paradigm in British Army recruits [31]. The cohort included 62 ACE I/I and 79 ACE D/D homozygotes, and the traininginduced increase in left ventricular mass was 2.7 times greater in the D/D genotype compared to the I/I homozygotes. Interestingly, the association between the ACE genotype and left ventricular mass response was not affected by angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibitor (Losartan) treatment [31].\n",

      "So far this chapter has dealt with the genetics of heterogeneity of responsiveness to physical activity in terms of interindividual differences in training-induced changes in risk factors. However, a similar phenomenon can be described in observational studies in terms of genotype-physical activity interactions on health-related traits. Akin to the variability in training responses, epidemiologists have also faced the fact that, despite the general inverse relationship between physical activity level and the risk of chronic diseases, some physically active individuals still develop the disease and some of their sedentary counterparts may remain healthy until advanced age. Already, a considerable amount of evidence shows that [33]  \n",

      "- o The etiology of these multifactorial traits is characterized by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors  \n",
      "The interactions between genetic and environmental factors can manifest themselves in several ways. One possible scenario for the interactions between genotype and physical activity and obesity is presented in Figure 13.1. The lowest risk of disease is in subjects who lack the genetic risk factor and are physically active or have normal weight. In subjects with increased genetic risk, being active or maintaining normal body weight can potentially prevent or delay the onset of the disease, prevent the complications of the disease, or increase the subject's responsiveness to treatment. On the other hand, sedentary and/or obese persons may have an increased risk of morbidity in general; however, with a genetic predisposition, the disease may manifest at an earlier age, have more severe complications, and be more resistant to treatment. These examples underline the idea that a behavior or a state, such as physical activity or lack of obesity, can potentially compensate a genetic predisposition to a disease.  \n",

A multivariate analysis revealed a significant interaction between the hepatic lipase C-480T genotype and physical activity level on the coronary heart disease risk. The increased coronary heart disease risk associated with the T/T genotype was observed in the sedentary or moderately active subjects, but not in subjects who participated in vigorous physical activities [36].\n",

King and coworkers investigated the risk of breast and ovarian cancer associated with the mutations in the BRCA7 and BRCA2 genes in Ashkenazi Jewish women [37]. Although mutations in both genes significantly increase the risk of breast cancer, the results suggested that physical activity and body weight might modify the penetration of the disease.  \n",

      "The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in human genetics. The availability of the almost complete DNA sequence of the human genome has changed our ability to study the genetic basis of complex multifactorial traits and to develop novel treatments for several chronic diseases. The recent advances in molecular genetics are starting to have an impact on physical activity research and exercise physiology. Although the research on molecular genetics of physical performance and health-related fitness is still in its infancy, understanding the effects of DNA sequence variation on interindividual differences in responsiveness to acute exercise and regular physical activity holds great promise. Such data would ultimately help to utilize physical activity more efficiently in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.\n",

      "The association between overweight or obesity and breast cancer incidence has been an area of extensive epidemiological research, beginning with studies in the 1970s that demonstrated that heavier women were at increased risk of breast cancer [1]. Such extensive research has been needed in part because the association of diverse measures of weight and body fat mass with breast cancer varies by a number of different characteristics of women. For example, the epidemiological evidence on weight or body mass index (BMI - a measure of weight adjusted for height, most commonly weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and breast cancer risk varies by menopausal status (Table 14.1), age at diagnosis, hormone receptor status of the breast cancer, and exposure to exogenous estrogens. In addition, the associations observed vary by time period during the life cycle when weight or BMI is measured.  \n",
      "This chapter will summarize the epidemiological evidence on overweight and obesity and breast cancer risk over three major periods in the life cycle: birth and early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The most informative studies have distinguished between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer; examined the effect of weight or BMI, weight gain, and central body fat; and examined the differential effects of exposure to endogenous and exogenous estrogens. With the recognition of the potential role of insulin-related peptides and possible interactions between these peptides and estrogen, recent studies have also begun to explore the potential interactions of insulin-related peptides with body size. Because studies of breast cancer have used so many different BMI cutpoints that are not consistent with current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of overweight and obesity, the term \"heavier women\" is used to describe the upper BMI groups rather than the terms \"overweight\" and \"obese.\"\n",

      "Investigators have increasingly begun to examine the risk for many chronic diseases by standard WHO BMI categories: underweight as BMI of less than 18.50, normal weight as BMI of 18.50 to 24.99, and overweight as BMI of 25.00 or higher. This latter overweight category is further subdivided into four categories: preobese 25.00 to 29.99, obese class I 30.00 to 34.99, obese class II 35.00 to 39.99, and obese class III ≥ 40.00 [2]. More recent meta-analyses have the ability to examine risk by these broad weight categories; however, analyses should not be limited to these categories because risk may vary within them, depending on the chronic diseases and the populations examined.\n",

      "A limited number of studies have examined weight or BMI at birth, during childhood, and early in adulthood relative to breast cancer. The data on birth weight and breast cancer are limited by a very small number of cases; most studies have fewer than 100 cases. Some studies find no association [3,4] or a nonsignificant increased risk [5,6]; others find an increase in risk with increasing birth weight for premenopausal but not postmenopausal breast cancer [7-11] or a stronger increase in risk for premenopausal compared to postmenopausal breast cancer [12,13]. One study that examined the association of measured birth weight with early onset premenopausal breast cancer (before age 40) found a significant relative risk of 1.25 for birth weights over 4000 g as well as a significant relative risk of 1.59 for low-birth weight of below 2500 g [14] compared with birth weights in the middle range. Some studies have found an association between birth weight and adult BMI [15,16], suggesting that women with a high birth weight may also have a high adult BMI, which is also associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.\n",

      "The association of young adult weight, BMI, or other measures of relative weight adjusted for height has been examined in over 35 case-control studies and at least seven cohort studies and was well summarized in a review by Okasha et al. in 2003 [17]. In most of these studies, weight and height are based on self-report during midlife in which women are asked to recall their weight and height at age 18 or 20, but have included self-report of weight and height at various ages from age 12 to 25. In most case-control studies, heavier weight or BMI during teenage and young adulthood is associated with a 10 to 30% decrease in breast cancer risk for pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.  \n",
      "However, this decreased risk is most often not statistically significant [18-41]. In one cohort study that examined changes in risk by 5-year intervals from age 30 to 69 for relative weight based on measured weight and height [42], the relative risk associated with BMI was less than 1 up to age 55 (comparing the highest to the lowest BMI quintiles) and gradually increased to 1.22 by ages 65 to 69. Few studies have measured heights and weights at younger ages and, with the exception of a study by Le Marchand et al.

Other studies find no association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer [52–54]. Relative risks of approximately 0.6 to 0.7 have been reported whether weight or BMI is assessed at the time of diagnosis or at earlier times during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood [18,25,27,55]. Early studies suggested that the protective effect among heavier women was limited to early stage disease due to poorer detection of small tumors [43,44]. However, subsequent studies in these same groups suggest that detection bias does not explain the increased risk for breast cancer observed among lean premenopausal women [18,27,49].  \n",

A metaanalysis of seven cohorts comprising 723 incident cases of invasive breast cancer in premenopausal women found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.54 for women with a BMI higher than 31 compared to women with a BMI less than 21 [56]. This estimate is consistent with the reduction in risk of 0.6 to 0.7 observed in many studies and does not appear to be present for BMIs less than 28.  \n",
      "Conversely, most studies have found that heavier women are at increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [1,19-22,24-26,29,30,33,34,37,40-42,46,50-52,54,55,57-75]. A meta-analysis of seven cohorts comprising 3208 cases of invasive postmenopausal breast cancer found gradual increases in risk to a BMI of 28 after which risk did not increase further; the relative risk for a BMI of 28 compared with a BMI of less than 21 was 1.26 [56]. The majority of studies on BMI and breast cancer risk have adjusted for major breast cancer risk factors, including reproductive factors. Few studies have examined in detail the effect of confounding or interactions with diet and physical activity.  \n",
      "Breast density has recently emerged as an important breast cancer risk factor. However, studies on obesity and breast cancer have not generally had information on breast density and thus have not examined the effect of any possible interactions between obesity and breast density. Only one study in Vermont that had data on breast density from screening mammograms has controlled for the effect of breast density [71]. Because BMI is inversely related to breast density, adjustment for breast density resulted in an increase in the risk estimations at all levels of BMI; the odd ratio increased from 1.9 to 2.5 after adjustment for breast density among obese women.  \n",
      "When examined, risk estimates for the association between obesity and breast cancer vary by age at diagnosis, history of hormone replacement therapy, estrogen receptor status of the tumor, and, possibly, family history of breast cancer. Risk has been found to increase with age at diagnosis in some studies that include a substantial number of postmenopausal women older than 65 years [51,56,66,71]. In one study, risk estimates increased from 1.1 among women younger than 60 years to 1.8 among women older than 65 years [66].  \n",
      "The effect of exogenous estrogen or estrogen receptor status of tumors has been examined with stratified analyses in more recent studies (Table 14.2). In these studies, obesity-related risk has been higher among women who have never used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as shown in Table 14.2 [23,41,51,71,74,75]. Huang et al. were the first to report this finding in a large cohort study in the U.S. They found a statistically significant BMI and estrogen replacement interaction, with no increase in risk (RR of 1.1) among all women, but an increase in risk (RR of 1.6) among heavier women who had not used HRT [23]. The Women's Health Initiative cohort in the U.S., which had measured height and weight, found an even larger increase in risk among obese postmenopausal women who had never used HRT (RR of 2.52 among women with a BMI of over 31.1 kg/m²), but no increase in risk in similarly obese women who had ever used HRT [41].  \n",
      "At least three studies have examined risk by BMI and estrogen receptor status of the breast tumor [37,52,73]. In one U.S. study, risk for a BMI of 27 compared to a BMI of 22 was 2.4 for tumors that were estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive [37]. In another study, risk estimates were 2.0 and 2.2 for a BMI of 30.7 compared to a BMI of 23 for estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone-positive tumors, respectively [73]. In both of these studies, obesity-related risk was not increased for estrogen- and progesterone receptor-negative tumors. In one Japanese study, risk did not vary by estrogen or progesterone status of the tumor [52]. However, the women in this study were lean; the upper quartile of BMI of 22 in this study is lower than the lowest quartile of BMI in most U.S. studies.  \n",
      "Data are very limited on variation in BMI-related risk for postmenopausal breast cancer by family history. In several studies from the Iowa Women's Health Study, heavier postmenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer have a greater risk of developing breast cancer than do heavier women without a family history [30,73]. In one study in Japan, no differences were observed in associations of weight, BMI, or change in BMI by family history for premenopausal breast cancer, although somewhat stronger associations were seen for weight and change in BMI and postmenopausal breast cancer among postmenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer; this confirmed earlier results by Sellers and colleagues [73]. Only one study has examined variation in BMI-related risk for premenopausal breast cancer by family history of breast cancer [76]. In that study, the inverse association commonly observed between BMI and breast cancer risk was only observed in women without a family history of breast cancer.\n",

      "Data on central adiposity and premenopausal breast cancer do not suggest a consistent association between measures, such as waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio, and breast cancer risk [22.49-51.54.77-81]. Only five of these studies observed statistically significant increases in risk [50.54.77,78,81]. Increases in central adiposity, assessed by waist circumference or the ratio of waist to hip circumference, have been associated with a 1.3- to 2.0-fold increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women in most studies [21,30,41.51.54.77-80,82-85]. However, not all studies show this association [74,81,86,87].  \n",
      "The association in postmenopausal women may be modified by a family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In the Iowa Women's Health Study, among women with elevated waist-to-hip ratio, only women with a positive family history of breast cancer were at increased risk. The combination of a high wasit-to-hip ratio with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer was associated with a more than fourfold increase in risk of breast cancer [21,88]. Several studies have also reported on the association of hip circumference with breast cancer; most show no association among premenopausal women [79,80,89]. Among postmenopausal women, variable increases in risk with increasing hip circumference have been found in some [41,51.74.80] but not all [21.79.89] studies. In the few studies that have examined risk stratified by HRT use, risk for increases in waist and hip circumference were increased among women who had never used HRT but were not increased among women who had ever used HRT [41,51,74].  \n",

      "The most consistent body size predictor of postmenopausal breast cancer risk is adult weight gain [4.18.21.23.34.37.40.51.53.54.59.65,67.70.72.74.75.90-941. This association has been found in cohort studies that found no association between BMI at baseline and subsequent development of breast cancer and that also adjusted for baseline BMI [21,23,82]. Findings from one of the largest cohort studies suggest that a doubling of risk occurred with a weight gain of more than 20 kg after the age of 18 years, but only among women who had never used postmenopausal HRT [23]. Other studies have also observed similar results, with increases in risk limited to or much larger among women who have gained more weight and who have never used HRT compared to current users [24,34,51,72,74,75].  \n",
      "Consistent with findings for BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, weight gain appears to be associated with a reduced or no significantly increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in most studies [18,23,26,27,35,36,39,40.51,53,54]. However, a study by Wenten et al. in New Mexico found differences in risk for Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white women [40]. In that study, no association was found between weight gain and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among non-Hispanic white women: in contrast, a nonstatistically significant but nearly twofold increased risk was observed with more than 14 kg of weight gain among Hispanic white women.  \n",
      "The only study that has examined the effect of percent body fat measured by bioelectric impedance as well as several other measures of body size, fat mass, and distribution found the strongest association for percent body fat, with a doubling of risk for women with a percent body fat of over 36% compared to women with a percent body fat of less than 27%. Similar to results reported for BMI and weight gain, risk for percent body fat was stronger among women who had never used HRT. Among women with a percent body fat of more than 36%, the risk estimate among women who did not use HRT was 3.4 compared to 1.0 among women using HRT [74].\n",

      "The majority of research on the association of obesity with breast cancer incidence has been based on white populations from Europe, Canada, and the U.S. A limited number of studies in other racial or ethnic groups suggest there may be some differences in observed associations among Hispanic and African American women; observed associations in Asian populations have been similar to those among white women. Among the major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., African American women have the highest prevalence of obesity. Several studies have estimated that the high rates of severe obesity may account for some of the later stage at diagnosis observed for African American women in comparison to white women [95,96]. However, few studies have examined the association of BMI or regional adiposity with breast cancer in African American women.  \n",
      "In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, similar patterns of an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer were observed for African American and white women. In contrast to other studies, BMI was not associated with an increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer in African American or white women. Curiously, an increased waist-to-hip ratio, a measure of central adiposity, was associated with an increased risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer, although the increased risk estimates were only statistically significant among premenopausal women. A small case-control study in Nigeria found an increased risk (RR = 1.82, 955 CI = 0.78 to 4.31) for breast cancer for women with a BMI of 30 or more; however, the risk estimate was not statistically significant due to small numbers (only 104 breast cancer cases) [97].  \n",
      "National data also indicate that Hispanic women in the U.S. have higher rates of obesity. Studies on the association of BMI and other measures of obesity and breast cancer incidence among Hispanic women are very limited. One study in New Mexico that included Hispanic white and non-Hispanic white women found that usual BMI and weight change during adult life increased risk for premenopausal as well as postmenopausal breast cancer among both groups of women. However, none of the relative risk estimates in this analysis stratified by menopausal status and ethnicity were statistically significant because of limited sample size. One small study in Brazil found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer and a positive association between BMI and postmenopausal breast cancer.  \n",
      "Larger studies are needed in these populations in the U.S. to better define how obesity in these populations is associated with breast cancer. In contrast, a number of studies among Asian populations in the U.S., Japan, and China have found similar associations between obesity and breast cancer risk as those observed among white populations.\n",

      "As summarized by Bernstein and Patel in Chapter 4 of this book and in other recent reviews [98-100], the evidence that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer is increasing. A limited number of studies on physical activity and breast cancer risk have had sufficient numbers of cases to examine the effect of physical activity stratified by BMI. Several of these studies have found a greater reduction in risk with being physically active among women who were in the lower range of BMI.  \n",
      "Unfortunately, studies of obesity and breast cancer risk have rarely reported on the association of BMI stratified by physical activity. One exception is a study by Enger et al. that examined the interaction of BMI and physical activity for ER+/PR+ tumors; these researchers did not find statistically significant interaction but did observe the greatest reductions in risk among women with low BMI (defined as BMI < 23.7 kg/m² and higher levels of physical activity (17.6 + METhours/week) [37]. More work is needed among large studies with good measures of physical activity and BMI before conclusions can be reached on whether the effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk is different among lean as compared to overweight and obese women.\n",

      "In the area of breast cancer incidence, research on the association of weight, BMI, and other measures of fat distribution and weight change during middle and older adult life has been extensive. New research on these measures in this time of life should focus on exploring underlying mechanisms by which these exposures may influence cancer risk. Although recent research has examined differences in association by exogenous estrogen exposure, few studies have examined whether risk associated with obesity and other measures varies by characteristics of the tumor, such as hormone receptor status [37]. As basic and clinical research identifies additional specific tumor markers that may influence disease progression, it will be important to design studies to examine the effect of BMI, weight gain, and measures of fat distribution on the relative proportion of tumors that express these markers.  \n",
      "In addition, the interactions among diet, physical activity, and weight and breast cancer risk have been minimally explored. Such studies require very large samples with good measures of all of these exposures to have the power to identify differential effects in population subgroups. Although adult weight gain from young adult to middle life has been a consistent risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, research is needed on the effect of changes in weight during different periods in time when the breast may be undergoing rapid change, such as during puberty and pregnancy (Figure 14.1). Only a limited number of studies have attempted to examine this issue and these have not had repeat measures of weight across all of these time periods or have had to rely on recall in weight from the distant past.  \n",

      "but not for weight gain in the young adult period or in the later postmenopausal period. However, given the missing information about weight at younger ages, this study did not have the power to explore the effect of weight gain during puberty and pregnancy fully.  \n",
      "In order to examine the contribution of estrogen as the underlying mechanism by which obesity influences breast cancer risk, studies have examined the risk of obesity or weight gain in groups stratified by HRT or estrogen status of the tumor. However, few studies have examined whether the effect of insulin-related peptides vary by BMI. Research is beginning to be published on the role of metabolic syndrome (obesity, glucose intolerance, low-serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) and breast cancer incidence [101]. Similarly, a limited number of studies have begun to explore the effect of high glycemic load or glycemic index and cancer risk for other cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. Some evidence suggests that these dietary patterns are more likely to lead to abnormalities in glucose metabolism and insulin processing among obese as compared to normal weight individuals. Therefore, research should be designed to examine whether such differential effects occur for breast cancer outcomes in normal as compared to overweight women.  \n",
      "Research is beginning to explore whether measures postulated to relate to immune function, such as C-reactive protein, may be adversely affected in obesity and therefore be another mechanism by which obesity increases disease risk. In addition, the identification of biologically active cytokines produced by adipose tissue, such as leptin and adiponectin, is beginning to be examined for a possible role in breast cancer. For example, two small case-control studies have found that low serum adiponectin levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, possibly through a nonestrogen-mediated mechanism [102,103]. At present, studies examining the role of cytokines and other inflammatory markers are very limited in breast cancer. However, such measures may be available in many large cohort and case-control studies and may be a promising area of exploration in the future.  \n",
      "Finally, most of the obesity-related research in breast cancer has been done based on general risk populations of white women. Future research is needed to examine how BMI, weight gain, and measures of regional adiposity influence risk for breast cancer among women from different racial and ethnic groups, as well as women at increased risk of cancer as assessed by family history or specific molecular markers of genetic susceptibility. One study has reported that, among women with inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, women who were normal weight and physically active in adolescence had a delayed onset of breast cancer [104].\n",

      "Extensive data from case-control and cohort studies provide convincing evidence of a modest 30% increased risk of postmenopausal breast cell cancer from overweight and obesity and a larger twofold increase in risk for adult weight gain. Estimates from a meta-analysis of cohort studies found gradual increases in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer to a BMI of 28, after which risk did not increase further. The relative risk for a BMI of 28 compared with a BMI of less than 21 was 1.26 [56]. However, risk estimates vary by age at diagnosis, history of HRT, and estrogen receptor status of the tumor with a much stronger risk observed among overweight and obese women who have never used HRT or who have estrogen-positive tumors.  \n",
      "Another meta-analysis found that this increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer corresponded to a 12% increase for an overweight woman and a 25% increase for an obese woman [105]. A stronger association is seen for adult weight gain, with a doubling of risk among women who have never used HRT and who gained over 20 kg from age 18 [23]. A meta-analysis of cohort studies found an inverse association between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.54 for women with a BMI higher than 31 compared to women with a BMI of less than 21 [56]. This estimate is consistent with the reduction in risk of 0.6 to 0.7 observed in many studies and does not appear to be present for BMIs less than 28. Data on the association of various measures of regional adiposity, such as waist or hip circumference, are limited and less consistent, with few finding associations among premenopausal women and some showing increases in risk among postmenopausal women with increased waist or hip circumferences.  \n",
      "Given the strength of the evidence from observational epidemiological studies on the role of obesity in postmenopausal breast cancer risk, a logical next question to be examined is the effect of weight loss in reducing risk. Few observational epidemiological studies have examined the effect of weight loss on disease risk because of the inability to distinguish intended from unintended weight loss related to coexisting disease. Because of this potential bias, reports of the association of weight loss with breast cancer outcomes from observational epidemiological studies must be interpreted with caution and few studies have examined this issue. In fact, most studies have included women with weight loss in the reference group when examining the association of changes in weight or BMI with breast cancer risk.  \n",
      "The limited number of studies that have examined the association of weight loss separately have not found statistically significant associations between weight loss and risk [23,65,67,69,72,90]. Only one study has examined the effect of intentional weight loss on breast cancer risk. In that study from the Iowa's Women's Health Study, intentional weight loss of 20 or more pounds was associated with a 21% reduction in risk of subsequent postmenopausal breast cancer (RR = 0.79 95% CI = 0.65 to 0.97) [106]. After adjustment for multiple other breast cancer risk factors, this reduced risk was essentially unchanged (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.00). This study also found a reduction in risk among women who had lost at least 10 lb from their maximum weight (RR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.98).  \n",
      "Research has begun to explore the effect of randomized controlled trials of weight loss and specific diet and physical activity changes on physiological factors that may influence breast cancer risk, such as estrogen, androgens, and insulin-related peptides. Evidence from these studies is summarized in Chapter 7 in this book. Conclusive evidence of the effect of weight loss on breast cancer risk will require randomized controlled trials of weight loss involving changes in diet and physical activity.  \n",
      "Only a few studies have attempted to estimate the population-attributable risk or what proportion of postmenopausal breast cancer can be attributed to overweight and obesity. In 2001, Bergstrom et al. estimated that about 9% of postmenopausal breast cancer could be attributed to overweight and obesity [105]. However, that estimate was based on rates of overweight and obesity in European countries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Current rates of overweight and obesity among women in the U.S. are much higher. For example, the rate of obesity among women in Europe in the Bergstrom study was 13%, but the rate of obesity among women in the U.S. today is about 33%. Therefore, a rough estimate of the population-attributable fraction of breast cancer due to overweight and obesity today in the U.S. may be closer to 15%. Given evidence of a continued increase in obesity in the U.S. and internationally, it is likely that obesity will become an increasingly important contributor to breast cancer risk worldwide.\n",

      "Many aspects of the associations among body weight, obesity, and colorectal cancer have been examined. Colorectal cancer has been studied looking at the combined colon and rectal areas, as well as each site separately. Additionally, unlike many cancers, associations between body size and the precursor lesion, adenomous polyps, have been reported. Weight and height data using body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), fat patterning using waist and hip circumference measurements, and weight change are indicators of body size that provide insight into the association and possible biological mechanisms underlying the association.  \n",
      "The literature is consistent in terms of reported associations between body size and colon and rectal cancers. Gender-specific associations have been observed almost universally, with stronger associations reported for men than for women [1]. Site-specific associations that have been reported suggest that obesity is associated mainly with colon cancer rather than rectal cancer, although studies that have examined proximal and distal colon cancers report stronger associations for distal rather than proximal tumors.  \n",
      "Most epidemiological studies examining the association with body weight and obesity have relied on self-reported height and weight. For case-control studies, the period of recalled height and weight varies from several years prior to diagnosis to the year prior to diagnosis; cohort studies usually use self-reported current height and weight, with varying individual time between reported data and cancer diagnosis. Height and weight measurements are converted to indicators of body mass, with BMI the most commonly used. Sometimes the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for overweight (BMI > 25) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) are used.  \n",
      "Unfortunately, most studies currently in the literature have not used WHO standards for determining obesity, thus making comparisons and interpretations across studies more difficult. Rather, most studies have categorized BMI based on distribution in the studied population. The upper range of BMI for many studies is close to the ≥30 set by WHO; however, sometimes the upper range is  \n",
      "at 26, which would indicate overweight but not obesity by the WHO criteria. Limited data exist on waist or hip circumference measurements as indicators of fat pattern and its impact on colorectal cancer risk. Few studies have evaluated BMI and circumference measures simultaneously to determine the independent effects of each. Also, limited information is available on weight change or early life body size as possible risk factors for colon and rectal cancer.\n",

      "Reported associations between body size and colon cancer have been fairly consistent across casecontrol and cohort studies. Studies of cases of 100 or more cases are shown in Table 15.1. Other studies with fewer cases provide similar estimates of association, although with less precision. Studies that have examined associations with obesity (a BMI of approximately ≥30) report slightly stronger associations than those that report associations for overweight or a BMI of over 25. For men, most studies report significantly increased risk, with relative risk estimates of around 2.0. although estimates range from 1.2 to 3.0. Most studies have adjusted for important confounding factors, including physical activity, dietary intake, and smoking; however, some report only ageadjusted estimates of association [1,2]. Most studies show evidence of a dose-response association.  \n",
      "Among women, associations are generally weaker than those observed for men and are often not statistically significant; point estimates are often around 1.4 and range from 0.7 to 2.7 [3-12]. Some variation in risk estimates among women may stem from ages of the women studied because stronger associations have been observed for pre- vs. postmenopausal women overall and postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy are at higher risk if they are overweight or obese than if they are normal weight [9].  \n",
      "The association between body size and risk of colon cancer in African Americans is not well documented: only one study of 99 cases evaluated the association between BMI and colorectal cancer [12], with imprecise estimates of association. The cohort study by Chyou and colleagues [13] showed only a weak association between BMI and colorectal cancer risk among Asian men living in Hawaii. It is unknown whether this weaker association is from the lower levels of BMI observed in that population or whether the lack of association is the result of some other unknown factors. Data on associations between body size and colon cancer among other racial and ethnic groups are limited.  \n",
      "Some studies that have been adequately powered to look at associations for proximal and distal colon tumors show stronger associations for distal tumors than proximal tumors [4,6,11,14], although the study by Le Marchand et al. [3] showed stronger associations with proximal rather than distal tumors. The study by Terry [5] did not observe a significant association for proximal or distal tumors; however, the study population was restricted to women and, given the weaker associations usually detected for women, this is not inconsistent with the literature. In a study by Le Marchand et al. [15] the greatest risk associated with a large BMI was observed for sigmoid tumors, which most studies include as part of the distal colon. Although most studies report associations between body size and incident cancers, Murphy et al. [16] report associations for mortality similar to those reported for incidence.  \n",
      "The association between colorectal neoplasia and body fat distribution, as indicated by the waist-to-hip ratio, is shown in Table 15.1 as the set of relative risks or odds ratios with high vs. low or normal levels of waist-to-hip ratio [4.17,18]. Results from case-control as well as cohort studies suggest that a higher waist-hip ratio increases risk of colon cancer. The ranges and distributions of this ratio differ substantially across the various studies; however, as was observed with BMI, the waist-to-hip ratio also shows a pattern of a positive association with increased colon cancer risk. In the studies displaying a dose-response pattern, no specific threshold for this association was found except in the study of males by Giovannucci et al. [19].  \n",
      "A study conducted by MacInnis and colleagues [14] evaluated several indicators of body size and body composition in coniunction with colon cancer risk. In addition to the observation that\n",

      "BMI and waist-to-hip ratio increased risk of colon cancer, with the strongest associations for distal tumors, researchers looked at fat-free mass and fat mass, based on bioimpedance data, and observed increased risk for both. The associations with BMI and fat mass were attenuated when adjusted for other factors. However, the association with fat-free mass and waist-hip ratio remained after adjustment for other body composition measures. The authors proposed two independent effects of body composition on risk of colon cancer: one associated with nonadipose mass and the other with central adiposity.  \n",

In general, no evidence suggests a stronger association between BMI earlier in life and colorectal neoplasia than one later in life. The cohort studies by Lee et al. [20] and Le Marchand et al. [15] show relative risks for BMI in the late second and the third decades of life similar to those for BMIs in later adulthood (all in the 1.4 to 1.6 range). Case-control studies suggest that elevated BMI in the later adult years and weight gain between early adult ages and later adult ages tends to increase risk for colon cancer [3,11].\n",

      "Few studies have examined associations between body size and rectal cancer and those that have generally reported results for few cases. From existing data, it appears that body size is not associated with rectal cancer among men or women [11.15.17.21–24]. The study by Slattery et al. [23] is the largest study of rectal cancer reported to date. In that study of almost 1000 rectal cancer cases, no difference was found in risk of rectal cancer associated with being overweight (BMI of >25) or obese (BMI of >30). Other components of energy balance, energy intake and energy expenditure, were associated in a similar manner as was observed for colon cancer using the same study population and methods to collect data [25]. This implies that increased BMI and a positive energy balance may be less important risk factors for rectal cancer than for colon cancer. Studies that have combined colon and rectal tumors generally observe weaker associations than those that report associations for colon tumors only.\n",

      "Studies of adenomas are important to provide evidence for the time (or times) in colorectal carcinogenesis when factors associated with body weight might be most important in colorectal cancer. Studies evaluating the association between body size and adenoma occurrence have examined associations by polyp size and type. Most studies have examined BMI with associations similar to those observed for colon cancer [26-29]. Some studies do not detect associations with adenomas and body size [30]. In a study that included cancer and adenomas, an increased risk with a large BMI was observed for large adenomas only, but not for colorectal tumors [31].  \n",

A large waist-to-hip ratio also has been associated with risk for adenomas, with stronger associations observed for larger adenomas [28,32]. The observation that BMI is more strongly associated with larger adenomas than with smaller ones suggests that obesity-related factors might be acting at a later stage in the development of cancer - perhaps by contributing to the promotion and progression of adenomas toward cancer. Alternatively, this pattern could be seen simply because there may be many other causes of small adenomas that do not progress; among people with small adenomas, those other causes serve to dilute-out the obesity association with risk.\n",

      "Evaluation of risk associated with body size in conjunction with other factors can provide insight into possible biological mechanisms. The factors most frequently evaluated with body size have included other components of energy balance, including physical activity and energy intake. Hormone replacement therapy, estrogen status, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also have been evaluated in conjunction with BMI [5,9]; Table 15.2 summarizes data from one large case-control study [9]. Given numbers of cases and controls available from that study, evaluation of interaction is possible. High levels of vigorous physical activity and low levels of energy intake have been shown to modify the colon cancer risk associated with obesity in several studies [3,20,25]. Studies further suggest that diet composition, specifically diets with a high glycemic index, may be important effect modifiers [33]. Hypothesis related to the assessment of these interactions stems from the energy balance equation that illustrates the relationship among energy intake, energy expenditure, and ability to maintain energy balance.  \n",

      "The hypothesis for assessing interactions between menopausal hormone use and estrogen developed from the observed gender-specific associations identified for BMI and colon cancer. Studies that have evaluated the interactions between obesity and estrogen or menopausal hormone use [5,9] have shown that being overweight or obese increases risk of colon cancer only among women who are estrogen positive (that is, premenopausal women or postmenopausal women using menopausal hormone therapy). As shown in Figure 15.1, among these women, risks associated with a large BMI are similar to associations observed in men, with risk estimates twice that of those for women who are lean. However, women who are estrogen negative (e.g., postmenopausal, not taking menopausal hormones) do not experience the same effect from being overweight or obese.  \n",
      "Further delineation between postmenopausal women who take and do not take menopausal hormones results in a risk for women not taking menopausal hormones that is not different from the referent; those who do take menopausal hormones have risk at the level of or slightly higher than that observed for men. In men it has been observed that, with advancing age, risk associated with being overweight or obese declines [9]. This could be the result of declining androgen levels that operate in a similar fashion to that of estrogen in regulating cancer risk associated with obesity because they have a similar influence as that of estrogen on insulin resistance [34].

      "Evaluation of the association between BMI and colon cancer looking at specific tumor mutations has provided insight into possible mechanisms of action and the role of body size in what may be specific disease pathways. Few studies have been reported to date, although those that have suggest that BMI may be involved in several pathways. One study reported that a large BMI was associated with Ki-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 [35]. The BMI associations appeared to be more specific for Ki-ras mutations in women than in men. BMI appeared to be associated equally with tumors with and without p53 mutations [36]. Obesity was reported as associated only with tumors that were stable in women; however, in men, obesity was associated with stable as well as unstable tumors [37].\n",

      "It has been proposed that the influence of energy balance on risk of colon cancer may embrace endogenous hormone metabolism [38]. The mechanisms that relate obesity to risk of colon cancer most likely include a complex metabolic pathway involving estrogen, insulin, and inflammation.  \n",
      "Perhaps the mechanism that may have the greatest effect on the association between BMI and colon cancer involves the insulin pathway and the cross-talk between insulin and estrogen/androgen. Support for this association comes from data looking at BMI risk by exposure to estrogen and menopausal hormone use as previously described. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by the different in risk observed for men and women and the interaction with physical activity. High levels of BMI are associated with high levels of insulin; on the other hand, adipose tissue stores estrogen that may be turned on in a low-estrogen environment, such as that seen in postmenopausal women. However, if the findings by MacInnis et al. [14] are repeated in other studies, and the fatfree mass and central adiposity are more important than BMI, it is possible that the BMI-associated colon cancer risk is operating through high insulin levels. Because studies support a significant interaction between BMI and estrogen, it is possible that insulin and estrogen pathways are both operational.  \n",
      "Insulin-related genes may interact with BMI to alter risk of colorectal cancer. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) have been proposed as involved in insulin-related pathways of cancer etiology. Polymorphisms of these genes have been identified, some of which have been shown to have effects on insulin resistance and/or diabetes. High serum IGF-1 levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and variation in serum IGF-1 levels has been associated with a 19 CA repeat polymorphism 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site [39,40]. In men, serum IGF-1 concentrations were lower with the 19CA genotype than for other IGF1 genotypes [41]. One could predict that this genotype might be associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.  \n",
      "High levels of IGFBP-3 have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer [42,43]. An A/C polymorphism at nucleotide -202 is associated with different levels of IGFBP-3 in a dose-response fashion, i.e., AA > AC > CC [44,45]. A Gly972Arg (G972R) polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene has been associated with insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes [46,47]. The G1057D IRS-2 polymorphism has been associated with obesity and therefore a plausible link to insulin resistance and colorectal cancer [48]. Studies also have suggested that IRS-2 is involved in insulin signaling and in the regulation of obesity [40]. One study evaluating the association between these genotypes and colon and rectal cancer risk observed a significant interaction between BMI and IRS-2 and risk of rectal cancer and a borderline significant association with colon cancer (Slattery, under review). For colon cancer, those with the DD genotype had the greatest risk if they also had a BMI of 30 or more. Those with the DD IRS-2 genotype were half as likely to develop rectal cancer at a BMI of <25 than those with the GG genotype.  \n",
      "Some studies suggest that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) also may be involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-mediated disease pathways. The VDR4 is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation and metabolic homeostasis [49-53]. Polymorphisms of the VDR gene most frequently studied include two restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in intron 8 (Bsm I and Apa I) and one in exon 9 (Taq I). These are in linkage disequilibrium with each other and with several 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) polymorphisms, including a poly A repeat [54].  \n",
      "At the start site of the gene, a polymorphism detected with a Fok I digest also has been studied and has been shown not to be in linkage disequilibrium with the other variants [54,55]. The polymorphism associated with lack of Fok1 digestion (F) changes the start site from the first STG to one that is three codons downstream; thus the F genotype is associated with a protein three amino acids shorter than that associated with the f genotype. VDR polymorphisms have been examined in conjunction with colorectal adenomas and cancer and SS and BB variants have been shown to reduce adenoma/cancer risk [56-58].  \n",
      "The ff genotype of the Fok I polymorphism has been reported in one study to increase risk of colorectal cancer [59]. VDR genotypes, BMI, physical activity, and energy intake have been evaluated with energy balance and risk of colorectal cancer in one study (Slattery et al., in press). Data from a population-based case control study of colon (1174 cases and 1174 controls) and rectal (785 cases and 1000 controls) cancers was used to evaluate the associations. The Bsm1, polyA, and Fokl VDR polymorphisms were evaluated. For colon cancer, those who were obese were at greater risk of colon cancer if they had the SS or BB (OR 3.50 95% CI 1.75 to 7.03; p interaction 0.03) or ff (OR 2.62 95% CI 1.15 to 5.99; p interaction 0.12) VDR genotypes. These findings are unexpected because the SS, BB, and ff alleles reduce risk of colon cancer overall.  \n",
      "Inflammation as a mechanisms related to obesity is being explored, although it is far from understood. Aspirin and other NSAIDs have been recognized as reducing risk of colorectal cancer for many years [60-65]. Although involvement in the COX-2 pathway has been thought to be the main biological mechanism underlying this association, it is possible that aspirin and NSAIDS may be involved in other biological mechanism. Cyclooxygenase-independent actions have been proposed, stimulated in part by the observations that NSAIDS inhibit tumor formation and growth in COX-deficient cell lines |59|.  \n",
      "It has been proposed that aspirin and other NSAIDs reduce inflammation and that a reduction in inflammation decreases insulin resistance [47,66-68]. High doses of salicylates have been shown to reverse hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rodents by sensitizing insulin signaling. In patients with type-2 diabetes, aspirin treatment has been shown to reduce fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and insulin clearance; aspirin reduced hepatic glucose production and improved insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake by 20% [59,65,69]. Aspirin/NSAID influence on insulin resistance appears to be independent of COX-2 inhibition; instead, it involves inhibition of NFKB and IKB and/or activation of PPARs. An interaction between aspirin and IRS-1 in antagonizing effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has also been reported [47,66] TNF-α is a major cause of insulin resistance associated with obesity and inflammation.  \n",
      "As with all mechanisms reviewed, it is possible that obesity is in the causal pathway associated with mechanisms involving estrogen/androgen, insulin, and inflammation rather than the cause. However, studies that have examined BMI after adjusting for NSAIDs and aspirin continue to see direct associations between BMI and risk of colon cancer. To better understand the mechanisms involved in the obesity/body composition relationship with colon cancer, it is necessary to consider obesity and body composition alone. Research directed at understanding the components of energy balance and how they are mediated by factors such as estrogen and aspirin are needed.\n",

The concept of energy balance, or the ability to maintain body weight by balancing energy intake with energy expenditure, ties together important colon cancer risk factors, Elevated levels of body fat, as indicated by increased BMI during adult life and/or increased waist-to-hip ratio, are associated with increased risk for colon cancer and colon adenomas.  \n",
      "This association is seen for men and women, though it is higher for men. The reason for this difference by gender is not clear, although some data suggest that estrogen/androgen and aspirin/NSAIDs are involved in these differences. If obesity is simply an indicator of caloric imbalance then there should be no difference between the genders. On the other hand, obesity may have an offsetting beneficial effect among women. A factor such as the hyperestrogenemia associated with postmenopausal obesity could explain the gender differences — an estrogen benefit could be serving to blunt the obesity-related risk in women.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer is very much a disease of affluence, with age-standardized incidence rates that are up to ten times higher in Western, industrialized countries than in rural Asia or Africa [1,2]. Studies on time trends, as well as on migrants from low- to high-risk areas, have clearly shown that nongenetic (lifestyle) factors are to be held responsible for the large international differences in incidence rates.  \n",
      "One of the key risk factors for endometrial cancer among pre- and postmenopausal women is excess body weight [3,4]. In many studies, endometrial cancer risk was found to rise approximately linearly with increasing body mass index (BMI), especially among postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, several studies have shown a threshold effect, with an increase in risk only among obese women with a BMI of about 30 kg/m² or higher [3]. Overall, excess body weight has been estimated to account for up to about half of endometrial cancer incidence in Western Europe and the U.S. [5].  \n",
      "The endometrial tissue consists of stroma, vascular endothelium, and glandular and surface epithelium. These various cell types respond to sex steroids and other hormones in the circulation and also secrete a variety of growth factors that act as paracrine and autocrine regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Inhibition of cellular differentiation and apoptosis, and stimulation of cell proliferation, enhance tumor development by favoring the accumulation and fixation of mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, by stimulating the clonal expansion of cells with mutations and by enhancing the growth of established tumors [6-9].  \n",
      "From a histological and molecular pathology perspective, the vast majority (>80%) of endometrial tumors (referred to as \"type I\") are endometrioid carcinomas, which are generally associated with endometrial hyperplasia [10,11]. These carcinomas often show mutations in the ras protooncogene and in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, but not in the P53 tumor suppressor gene. Other (type-II) tumors are more often serous papillary, clear cell, or squamous carcinomas; these generally  \n",
      "develop from atrophic endometrial tissue in older women [10,12,13] and often show P53 mutations, but not ras or PTEN mutations. Most epidemiological studies did not distinguish between these two tumor types. Nevertheless, some evidence indicates that endocrine and nutritional lifestyle factors, including obesity, affect the risk of type-I but not type-II tumors [10,11].  \n",
      "Excess body weight is associated with a number of major changes in endocrine metabolism. Increasing evidence suggests that these endocrine changes - chronic hyperinsulinemia, decreased serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and increased levels of total and bioavailable androgens and estrogens (see also Chapter 7) - may provide the metabolic link between excess body weight and endometrial cancer development. In the present chapter, the relationships among excess weight, endogenous sex hormones, and endometrial cancer risk are discussed.\n",

      "Document 263:\n",
      "The predominant theory describing the relationship between endogenous steroid hormones and endometrial cancer risk is known as the unopposed estrogen theory [14]. This stipulates that endometrial cancer risk is increased in women who have high plasma bioavailable estrogens and/or low plasma progesterone so that mitogenic or proapoptotic effects of estrogens are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone.  \n",
      "A first observation upon which the unopposed estrogen theory was based is that endometrial proliferation rates are increased during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone levels are low and estradiol levels are at normal premenopausal concentrations [14]. More recent studies showed that, to a large part, the proliferative action of estradiol on endometrial tissue is mediated by an increased local production (mostly by stromal tissue) of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) [15–20]. The antiproliferative action of progesterone, on the other hand, has been shown to be largely mediated by enhanced local synthesis of IGF-binding protein-1, which is the most abundant IGF-binding protein in endometrial tissue and inhibits IGF-I action [21-26].  \n",
      "A second major observation that led to the unopposed estrogen theory was that endometrial cancer risk is increased among women using exogenous estrogens, but no such increase occurs when the estrogens are combined with progestins. Studies in the 1970s showed an increase in endometrial cancer risk among users of sequential oral contraceptives containing a long-duration. relatively potent estrogen (ethinylestradiol) and a short-duration weak progestin (dimethisterone) [27]. By contrast, the use of combined oral contraceptives that contain progestins for at least 10 days per monthly cycle (in addition to estrogen) has been associated with no increase [27,28] or only a moderate increase [29] in endometrial cancer risk.  \n",
      "Among postmenopausal women, use of estrogen-only replacement therapy has been shown to increase endometrial cancer risk. No such increase has been found for women who used estrogen-progestin replacement therapy to which progestins were added sequentially for at least 10 days in a 1-month cycle (sequential estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy or continuously (combined estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy [27,30,31].  \n",
      "In addition to these observations, increasing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that elevated postmenopausal levels of endogenous estrogens and reduced premenopausal levels of progesterone are risk factors for endometrial cancer (see following sections).\n",

      "Document 264:\n",
      "Relationships of endometrial cancer risk with blood levels of endogenous estrogens have been examined in a number of case-control studies and in two prospective cohort studies.  \n",
      "Among postmenopausal women, several case-control studies have shown decreased plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) [32,33], as well as increased total [32–39] and bioavailable [32,39] estrogens, in endometrial cancer patients compared to cancer-free control subjects. Similar observations were made in one prospective cohort study in New York [40] and in a subsequent extension of this study that combined a total of 124 cases and 236 controls from three prospective cohorts in New York, Northern Sweden, and Milan. In the extended study, endometrial cancer risk increased approximately sixfold for postmenopausal women in the top quintile of bioavailable estradiol (unbound to SHBG) compared to those in the bottom quintile [41].  \n",
      "Among premenopausal women, one large case-control study showed decreased total and bioavailable estradiol in endometrial cancer patients, although they also had lower levels of SHBG and higher levels of estrone [32]. Contrary to the observations made in postmenopausal women, the lack of direct association of premenopausal serum estradiol levels with endometrial cancer risk has been tentatively explained (with support of some other observations) by the possible existence of a nonlinear relationship of estrogen levels with endometrial cancer. According to the latter hypothesis, endometrial cancer risk would be directly related to serum estradiol levels only within the postmenopausal range of 5 to 20 pg/ml, whereas there would be no such relationship within the premenopausal range (above 50 pg/ml) [14].  \n",
      "Excess weight results in increased estrogen concentrations from peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue by aromatase enzyme [42-44]. After menopause, when ovarian production of estrogens stops, peripheral conversions in adipose tissue of Δ4-androstenedione to estrone and of estrone and testosterone into estradiol become the primary source of endogenous estradiol [42,45]. Thus, in postmenopausal women, degree of adiposity appears to be linearly related to plasma levels of estrone and estradiol, as well as to levels of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG [38,42,46-58].  \n",
      "In premenopausal women, contrary to postmenopausal women, excess weight and chronic hyperinsulinemia have little effect on levels of total or bioavailable estradiol [59–62]. This is due to the relatively minor contribution of estrogen production by adipose tissue compared to the ovarian estrogen production, plus the fact that, in premenopausal women, total and bioavailable estrogen levels are also regulated through negative feedback of estradiol on the pituitary secretion of folliclestimulating hormone.\n",

      "Document 265:\n",
      "Several case-control studies have shown that endometrial cancer risk is also increased in pre- and postmenopausal women with elevated plasma levels of Δ4-androstenedione [32,37,38] and testosterone [63,64]. Elevated circulating androgens have also been associated with hyperplasia of the endometrium, which generally precedes and accompanies the occurrence of type-I endometrial carcinomas [10,11,65,66]. In addition to these observations, there is clear evidence for an increase in endometrial cancer risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome - a complex metabolic syndrome of ovarian hyperandrogenism characterized by elevated plasma levels of testosterone and Δ4-androstenedione and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (signs of anovulatory menstrual cycles) [67].  \n",
      "Due to chronic anovulation and thus the lack of ovarian corpus luteum formation, this syndrome is also related to a deficit of ovarian progesterone production and low plasma progesterone levels. Cases of polycystic ovary syndrome in women developing endometrial cancer have been frequently reported, especially in young patients below the age of 40 [68-76]. Furthermore, several casecontrol and cohort studies have shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer among women who have polycystic ovary syndrome or among infertile women who were clinically characterized by normal plasma estrogen levels but a deficiency of progesterone, with relative risk estimates between about 3.0 to 9.0 [77-80]. Prevalence estimates of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome in premenopausal women vary between 3 and 8%, ranking it among the most common female endocrine  \n",
      "disorders [81-85]. On the basis of these prevalence figures and of estimated average fivefold increase in endometrial cancer risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, this syndrome can account for about 24% of endometrial cancer cases among young, premenopausal women.  \n",
      "Although endometrial tissue contains androgen receptors [86,87], androgens do not appear to have any direct stimulatory effect on endometrial cell proliferation; in fact, it is possible that they may even reduce proliferation rates [88-91]. The association of plasma androgen levels with endometrial cancer risk is thus more likely to be explained by an increase in estrogens, especially in postmenopausal women, for whom plasma androgen levels are a key determinant of the amounts of estrogens formed in the endometrium and adipose tissue. In premenopausal women, ovarian androgen excess most likely increases endometrial cancer risk through reductions in ovarian progesterone production.  \n",
      "Excess body weight generally has not been found to be strongly related to plasma levels of Δ4-andorstenedione and testosterone in postmenopausal women [46,92-94] or in normoandrogenic premenopausal women [95-100], although obesity-induced lowering of SHBG concentrations does result in increased levels of bioavailable T, unbound to SHBG [96,99,101-105]. In premenopausal women with ovarian hyperandrogenism polycystic ovary syndrome, however, excess weight and chronic hyperinsulinemia are related to increased absolute serum androgen concentrations (see next section).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Document 266:\n",
      "One major metabolic consequence of excess body weight is insulin resistance, which in turn leads to chronically elevated fasting and nonfasting plasma insulin levels [106-108]. Several studies have shown that chronically elevated blood insulin concentrations can be a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk is increased in pre- and postmenopausal women with non-insulindependent diabetes [109-113] - a condition generally associated with long periods of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia before as well as after its diagnosis.  \n",
      "Furthermore, the results from at least two epidemiological studies in postmenopausal women suggest an increased risk with hyperinsulinemia, even in nondiabetic subjects. One large casecontrol study showed endometrial cancer risk to be associated with serum levels of C-peptide, a marker of pancreatic insulin secretion [114]. A pooled, nested case-control study in cohorts in New York, Northern Sweden, and Milan (combining a total of 166 cases and 315 controls) showed a more than fivefold increase in endometrial cancer risk for women in the highest vs. the lowest quintile of plasma C-peptide [115]. This strong relationship persisted after adjustment for BMI.  \n",
      "Several mechanisms could explain the direct relationship of chronically elevated insulin with increased endometrial cancer risk. First, experiments in vitro have shown that insulin is a key regulator of IGFBP-1 gene expression and production in endometrial tissue [116-119]; thus, it seems likely that elevated insulin could increase IGF-I activity in endometrial tissue by downregulating endometrial IGFBP-1 levels [118,120]. Second, insulin is a key regulator of the hepatic synthesis and plasma levels of SHBG, downregulating SHBG levels, and is thus a direct determinant of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG, especially among postmenopausal women [46,93,95,104,121-132]. Finally, studies in vitro have shown stimulatory effects of insulin on androgen synthesis by ovarian tissue [133-135]; in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (but not in normoandrogenic women), hyperinsulinemia has been shown to be a major cause of ovarian androgen excess [134].  \n",
      "Close to half the women with clinical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome are severely overweight or obese. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are present in lean and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome [100,136-139], but are more severe in the obese subgroup [100,137,139-141]. Furthermore, most studies with polycystic ovary syndrome patients have shown  \n",
      "direct associations of obesity or plasma insulin with levels of total plasma testosterone and Δ4androstenedione [97,136,142-147], and anovulatory cycles are also more frequent in the obese and more insulin-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome patients [148-151]. In many women with polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin-lowering drugs can be used successfully to reduce ovarian androgen excess and restore regular menstrual cycles [152]. These various observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia may be a direct cause of chronic anovulation and progesterone deficiency.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer is very much a disease of the economically developed world. Epidemiological studies have shown that the high incidence rates in high-risk countries are to be attributed to lifestyle factors. One major lifestyle factor associated with increased endometrial cancer risk is excess body weight, and this association is most likely due to adiposity-induced alterations in endogenous hormone metabolism.  \n",
      "Epidemiological studies have shown increased endometrial cancer risks among pre- and postmenopausal women who have elevated plasma androstenedione and testosterone, as well as among postmenopausal women who have increased levels of estrone and estradiol. Furthermore, evidence is strong that chronic hyperinsulinemia is also an important risk factor. These various relationships of endometrial cancer risk with endocrine metabolism can all be interpreted in the light of the \"unopposed estrogen\" hypothesis, which proposes that endometrial cancer may develop as a result of the mitogenic effects of estrogens when these are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone. In premenopausal women, excess weight may increase risk by inducing hyperinsulinemia, ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome), chronic anovulation, and progesterone deficiency. Among postmenopausal women, excess weight most likely continues stimulating endometrial cancer development by increasing bioavailable estrogen levels through the aromatization of the androgens in adipose tissue and the reduction of serum levels of SHBG.\n",

      "Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. [1] and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in Europe [2]. Most patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed late in the progression of the disease and have a life expectancy of several months. In Europe and in the U.S., the 1-year and 5-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer are less than 25 and 5%, respectively, and mortality rates are essentially identical to incidence rates [2,3]. Survival rates have only improved slightly over the past decade due to the lack of significant medical advancements in the early detection or treatment of pancreatic cancer. The majority of pancreatic cancers are exocrine adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Islet tumors of the endocrine pancreas and other types of exocrine tumors (e.g., sarcomas) are very rare.  \n",
      "Pancreatic cancer is rare in the first three decades of life. After age 30, however, incidence rates increase exponentially and peak in the seventh and eighth decades [3]. Men consistently have higher incidence and mortality rates than women and, in the U.S., blacks have higher incidence and mortality rates than whites [3]. Pancreatic cancer rates are lower in developing countries than in developed countries [4]. Mortality rates in both sexes have increased over the past four decades in a number of countries where rates had been low in the mid-1950s, such as Japan, Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Poland, and Yugoslavia [5]. In Japan, age-standardized mortality rates have jumped from 1.4 per 100,000 to 12.5 per 100,000 in men between 1950 and 1995 [6], demonstrating that environmental factors play an important role.  \n",
      "Tobacco smoking is the one of the few established risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Inherited susceptibility explains a small fraction (5 to 10%) of pancreatic cancers, but the genes responsible for familial pancreatic cancer have not yet been identified. Late onset diabetes, or type-2 diabetes, has been consistently associated with elevated risks of pancreatic cancer. In a meta-analysis of 20 studies with data on the duration of diabetes prior to pancreatic cancer, individuals with diabetic histories of 5 or more years had a twofold elevation in pancreatic cancer risk compared to those without a history of diabetes, or diabetes of less than 5 years duration (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.2) [7]. In several recent studies, including three cohort studies, relative risks for pancreatic cancer ranged between 1.3 and 1.7 for individuals with long-standing diabetes (10 or more years), compared to those with no diabetes [8-11]. The strength and consistency of these studies suggest that a diabetic state, which develops 10 or more years prior to cancer diagnosis, is likely to be related causally to the development of pancreatic tumors.  \n",
      "The association between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk may be the result of years of elevated postload glucose concentration, hyperinsulinemia, and gradual impaired glucose tolerance. In a prospective study of nondiabetics in which blood was obtained an average of 25 years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis, postload glucose concentration was directly associated with pancreatic cancer risk in men and women [12]. In a similar prospective study with 10 years of follow-up, positive associations were observed between fasting serum glucose levels and pancreatic cancer mortality in men and women (trend test, p-value = 0.01) [13]. In that study, conducted in Korea, even modestly elevated fasting serum glucose levels were associated with higher pancreatic cancer mortality in women (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.81, for fasting glucose levels between 90 and 109 compared to <90 mg/dL) [13] . These two studies, together with the well-established relation with late onset diabetes, suggest that body weight and insulin resistance may play an important role in the etiology of pancreatic cancer.\n",

      "Human pancreatic tumors are believed to arise from ductal cells because tumors show ductal structure. However, it has been argued that tumors may arise from acinar cells [14], islets of Langerhans cells, or stem cells [1.5] and that they appear ductal in shape due to differentiation. In the hamster model (hamsters treated with the pancreatic carcinogen N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine [BOP]), which in many aspects is identical to the human disease, most ductal-type cancers develop within islets [16]. The histogenesis of pancreatic cancer is not well understood and difficult to establish because tumors are not usually detected until late in the progression of the disease.  \n",
      "At least two different mechanisms could contribute to a positive association between obesity and pancreatic cancer. The first mechanism described here involves insulin and insulin resistance and may also explain the relation between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. The second mechanism involves gastrointestinal hormones.  \n",
      "In vitro studies show that insulin promotes growth of hamster, rat, and numerous human pancreatic cell lines [17–25]. Although insulin is known to stimulate cell proliferation, it does not appear to be directly responsible in promoting pancreatic cancer, given that administration of exogenous insulin has an inhibitory effect on tumor induction in the hamster pancreatic cancer model [26,27]. Studies suggest that islet cell turnover, associated with insulin resistance, may play an important role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Stimulation of islet cell proliferation enhances pancreatic ductal carcinogenesis in hamsters [28], and the destruction of islet cells by streptozotocin or alloxan inhibits cancer induction [29-31].  \n",
      "In a recent study, hamster pancreatic cancer was inhibited by the drug metformin, which normalized insulin levels and the rate of islet cell turnover [32]. In a cohort study of patients with type-I diabetes (a disease in which islet cells are destroyed by the body), the number of pancreatic cancer cases observed was much lower than expected in those hospitalized with diabetes 15 or more years prior to cancer diagnosis (SIR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.1 to 3.8) [33]. Although the number of cases is small and results are unstable, this finding supports the hypothesis that islet cell proliferation may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.  \n",
      "The second mechanism that may explain the association between obesity and pancreatic cancer may be related to production of gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin or gastrin. Excess caloric intake, which can lead to weight gain, is likely to occur with frequent food consumption. With food intake, gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin and cholecystokinin, are elevated. Cholecystokinin, in turn, stimulates the secretion of enzymes from the exocrine pancreas. Cholecystokinin and gastrin promote growth of numerous pancreatic cancer cell lines [34-36]. In the rat  \n",
      "model, endogenous hypergastrinaemia and hypercholecystokininemia induced carcinogenesis in acinar cells of the pancreas [37-39]. Hypergastrinaemia, however, did not enhance induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster model [40], and findings of hypercholecystokininemia in hamster models have been inconsistent [41-44].\n",

      "Because of the rapidly fatal nature of pancreatic cancer, case-control studies on this cancer typically have low participation rates and rely heavily on next of kin (i.e., proxies) to obtain exposure data. In these circumstances, selection and recall biases are likely to occur. In an attempt to reduce error introduced when including proxy data, some case-control studies have chosen to keep only cases who responded directly to the questions asked. However, these case-control studies are more prone to survival bias because patients with the most aggressive cancers will be too ill or deceased by the time they are identified.  \n",
      "When studying body weight, case-control studies of pancreatic cancer may be more prone to recall bias because weight loss often occurs several years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis and is often a primary characteristic leading to the detection of this cancer. Similarly, use of proxies to obtain data on patients 2 years prior to interview may lead to weight misclassification because proxies are less likely to remember the patient's weight accurately. With proxy interviews, error in reporting weight may be random or biased if, for example, proxies consistently underestimate patients' weight. Recall bias due to weight loss and use of proxy interviews may explain why a number of case-control studies failed to observe associations between obesity and pancreatic cancer risk. In contrast, cohort studies are not prone to these types of errors because weight information is collected prior to disease and proxy interviews are not used.  \n",
      "Although the cohort study design is optimal to examine weight and pancreatic cancer, this type of study is often limited by power, given that pancreatic cancer incidence is ranked 11th out of all cancers (in the U.S., 2004) [1]. Consequently, men and women are often combined and numerous years of follow-up must be available to obtain reasonable sample sizes. Another potential limitation, which may apply to either type of study design but is perhaps more common in \"healthy\" cohorts, is weight range; some studies may not be suited to examine body weight if few participants classify as obese. In some cohort studies, the associations between weight and pancreatic cancer mortality have been reported, due to the lack of incidence data. However, mortality studies should lead to similar results, given the high fatality of pancreatic cancer.\n",

      "Results from case-control and cohort studies are summarized in Table 17.1. Four case-control studies observed no association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk [45-48]. All of these studies relied on proxy interviews to obtain body weight of cases. The largest was a collaborative case-control study that combined data from five studies in four different countries (Canada, Poland, The Netherlands, Australia) to obtain 802 pancreatic cancer cases [46]. No association with BMI was observed overall or in the five individual centers that contributed to the collaborative casecontrol study; detailed results from two of the five studies were published separately [45,47].  \n",
      "The four most recent case-control studies were conducted using only direct interviews and had over 300 cases of pancreatic cancer cases each (Table 17.1) [49-52]. Positive associations between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk were observed in men and women in all four studies. In two studies [49,51], \"usual\" adult weight was reported instead of current weight, which may have helped reduce bias associated with preclinical weight loss.

In this study, the association reported for the top BMI quartile and the linear test for trend were only statistically significant among men, possibly due to a smaller number of cases among women (n = 213). Positive associations of similar magnitude (relative risks ranging between 1.2 to 1.9) were observed for men and women in two Canadian studies using similar cutpoints for BMI (Table 17.1) [50,52]. The fourth study to show a positive association was conducted in an Asian population with relatively low BMI cutpoints for the highest category [51]. To date, this is the only study on weight and pancreatic cancer risk conducted in an Asian population. Studies suggest that Asian populations have a high percentage of body fat for a given BMI and also have higher diabetes or coronary heart disease risk than Europeans at the same BMI [53]. Therefore, it is conceivable that Asians may be at higher risk of pancreatic cancer with a smaller increase in BMI than Caucasians.\n",

      "To date, nine cohort studies have examined the association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk [12, 54–61]. In two of these studies, risks were calculated for pancreatic cancer mortality [59.60]. All but three [12.54.57] of the cohort studies relied on self-reported weight. The number of pancreatic cancer cases in these cohorts ranged between 65 and 3558 and cohort follow-up time ranged between 7 and 43 years. In the four largest cohorts, significantly elevated risks of pancreatic cancer were observed for obese individuals, compared to those with normal body weight [54,56,60,61].  \n",

At baseline, participants were asked to report their current weight and their weight 1 year earlier. Individuals who reported having lost more than 10 lb over the previous year were excluded from the analyses. The strongest relative risk of pancreatic cancer death was observed among women with BMI≥40 kg/m² (considered \"grade III overweight\"), compared to women with BMI < 25 kg/m²(RR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.36). Relative risks were also elevated among men with BMI >35 (RR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.99 to 2.22) and women with BMI between 35 and 39.9 (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.99), compared to men and women with normal BMI (<25; data were not given for men with BMI ≥ 40 because of low person-years in this group). Among men, the association between BMI and pancreatic cancer death was stronger when the analysis was restricted to those who had never smoked (RR = 2.61, 95% Cl = 1.27 to 5.35, for BMI ≥ 35 compared to normal weight).  \n",

In addition, an independent association was observed for central weight gain, compared with peripheral weight gain, after adjusting for BMI (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.07).  \n",
      "Obesity was also associated with elevated risk of incident pancreatic cancer in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts [56]. Weight was reported at baseline in each cohort and a total of 350 incident pancreatic cancer cases were included in the analyses (both cohorts). Similar associations were observed for men and women with BMI ≥ 30, compared to BMI < 23 (see Table 17.1). Tests for trend were statistically significant in both cohorts.  \n",
      "Four cohorts reported no association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk [55,57-59]; in a fifth, an association was detected among men but not women [12]. A narrow weight range and limited statistical power may explain why some of these studies failed to detect an association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk. In one of the studies, which consisted largely of elderly participants (65 to 85 years at baseline) living in a retirement community, few participants were overweight (top BMI cutpoint for men and for women was less than 24) [55]. Small case  \n",
      "numbers (n = 65) were another limitation to this study. In the College Alumni Health Study, the top BMI category cutpoint was 27.5 and only 10% of participants fell into that category. In the Chicago Heart Association cohort study, in which no association was detected among women, the top BMI category cutpoint was 26.2 for women (compared to 28.6 for men) and only 43 cases were women.  \n",
      "In a study of male smokers, no association was detected for weight and pancreatic cancer risk, even with a wide range in BMI [57]. It is conceivable that the association between weight and pancreatic cancer risk does not apply to heavy smokers. As mentioned above, in the CPS-II cohort, men who had never smoked had a much stronger association between BMI and pancreatic cancer death [60].  \n",
      "Results from a Swedish Twin Registry cohort also reported no association with weight, even among obese individuals (BMI > 30) [58]. However, the same study found an increase in risk of pancreatic cancer among those who reported an adult weight gain of 12 kg or more compared to those who gained 2 to 5 kg (RR = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.87 to 2.45).  \n",
      "In a different Swedish cohort, body weight was not reported, but weight gain was [62]. This study consisted of 35,000 men and women who participated in a general health examination in Malmö, Sweden, between 1974 and 1992. Incidence and mortality of cancer were obtained through linkage with the Cause of Death Register and the National Cancer Register; 43 pancreatic cancer cases were detected during follow-up. The authors reported a relative risk of 2.4 (95% CI = 1.1 to 4.9) for a greater than 10 kg increase in body weight since age 30 years, compared to all others, after controlling for smoking.\n",

      "In three studies, pancreatic cancer rates of patients with a hospital diagnosis of obesity were compared to those of nonobese individuals from similar populations [63–65]. Two of these studies detected follow-up incident cancer cases by record linkage to nationwide Cancer and Death Registries (Sweden [64] and Denmark [63]). In the study conducted in Sweden, follow-up ranged between 1 and 29 years and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for pancreatic cancer was 2.4 (95% CI = 1.6 to 3.4) among men and 1.1 (95% CI = 0.8 to 1.5) among women [64]. The risk was higher among obese men and women who were less than 60 years old at the time of followup (SIR = 2.5. 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.0). In the study conducted in Denmark, follow-up ranged between 1 and 11 vears and the standardized incidence ratio for pancreatic cancer was 1.8 (95% CI = 1.2 to 2.5) among men and 1.7 (95% CI = 1.3 to 2.2) among women [63]. In this cohort, the highest risk of pancreatic cancer was observed for men and women who were 60 to 69 years old at the time of the cancer diagnosis (SIR = 2.4).  \n",
      "The third obesity cohort study was conducted among male U.S. veterans [65]. Incident cases that occurred between 1 and 27 years of follow-up were included in the analysis; obesity was considered as a time-dependent variable. Among white men, the relative risk for pancreatic cancer given an obesity diagnosis was 1.20 (95% CI = 1.07 to 1.33) compared to nonobese men (5874 pancreatic cancer cases). The association between obesity and pancreatic cancer risk was not as strong among black men (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.34; 1721 pancreatic cancer cases).\n",

      "In a recent meta-analysis including 14 studies and 6391 pancreatic cancer cases, the summary estimated relative risk of pancreatic cancer using a random effects model was 1.19 for obese individuals (BMI ≥ 30) compared to those with a normal body weight (BMI ≤ 22; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.29; or, RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.03 for a unit increase in BMI) [66]. The combined estimated relative risk was higher among studies that adjusted for smoking in the analyses (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.03 for a unit increase in BMI), compared to those that did not adjust for smoking (RR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.03). Similarly, estimated relative risks were higher among studies that did not use proxy data (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.06 for a unit increase in BMI), compared to those that did (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.02, for a unit increase in BMI).\n",

      "Besides tobacco smoking, type-2 diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for pancreatic cancer. A causal association with type-2 diabetes is likely to exist because a number of studies observe elevated risks of pancreatic cancer with long-standing diabetes. The association between type-2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk may be due to elevated postload glucose concentration, hyperinsulinemia, and resulting insulin resistance, suggesting that body weight may also play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.  \n",
      "Earlier studies examining body weight and pancreatic cancer risk offered no indication that weight may be a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. Methodological issues in case-control studies, especially regarding the use of proxies, may explain the observed null results. More recent casecontrol studies using only direct interviews reported elevated risks of pancreatic cancer among men and women with elevated BMIs. A number of recent cohort studies observed similar associations. The largest cohort study (with smoking data), including 3558 pancreatic cancer cases, reported relative risks of mortality between 1.5 and 2.8 for obese men and women, compared to normal weight. The association in men was strongest among those who had never smoked.  \n",
      "Overall, animal and human studies suggest that a positive association between body weight and pancreatic cancer risk exists. The association may be strongest among men and women who are considered obese (i.e., BMI greater than 30). Future studies need to focus on the effects of physical activity.\n",

      "Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related morbidity and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death. Squamous cell carcinoma is still the predominant histological subtype worldwide, although incidence of this subtype is stable or decreasing [1,2]. Among men, African Americans are at a nearly sixfold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus compared to white men; however, risk among white men is four times higher for adenocarcinomas compared to that of African Americans. Among women, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma is lower than that of men, but is similar by race [3].  \n",
      "Incidence of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and in the closely linked gastric cardia has increased rapidly for at least 30 years. In the United States, Devesa [4] reported a crossover of the esophageal histological subtypes in the mid-1990s; adenocarcinomas became the predominant subtype, rather than squamous cell carcinoma, making it the fastest increasing cancer to date. These patterns are evident among men and women, although rates are much lower among women [3].  \n",
      "Reasons for the rapid increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma reported in most industrialized countries are not clear, but parallel an equally rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity and overweight status. Based on a representative sample of adult Americans, the estimated prevalence of obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 kg/m² or more, increased from 12% in 1991 to 18% in 1998 [5]. By 2001, this prevalence had increased to 21% [6], representing a 75% increase in a 10-year period. In the U.S., approximately 60% of the adult population is currently overweight (25 kg/m²) or obese [7]. Among obese individuals, the steepest increases have been reported among those with BMI of >40 kg/m², for whom prevalence has increased by a factor of four in the last 10 years [8]. Because of  \n",
      "under-reporting of weight increases with the respondent's actual weight, a prevalence estimate of 60%, which is based on self-reports, is likely an underestimate.  \n",
      "Obesity is associated with all-cause mortality [9] and with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases [10], diabetes, cancers of the colon, rectum, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, breast, corpus uterus, cervix, ovary, and kidney, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [11]. As reviewed in this chapter, obesity has also been recently associated with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia; these associations are independent of known risk factors, including cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.  \n",
      "Up to 90% of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus can be attributed to the synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use [12], and the precipitous decrease in the incidence of this histological subtype in the U.S. has been attributed to decreases in tobacco use. The strength of the association between alcohol and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastric cardia is weaker [13]. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of such adenocarcinomas is also inversely associated with gastrointestinal infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) [14]. However, strong evidence also implicates overweight and obesity in the etiology of these adenocarcinomas [15-18]. Cases of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia are more likely than controls to have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, or Barrett's metaplasia [17-19]. These conditions, which are considered precursors to esophageal adenocarcinoma [20], are also common among overweight and obese individuals.  \n",
      "The mechanisms by which obesity could increase risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma are unclear; mechanical as well as biochemical hypotheses have been proposed. Central obesity may predispose individuals to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus by initiating a cascade of events, beginning with hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which predominantly affects the gastroesophageal junction [15,21]. Constant irritation of squamous cells in the lower third of the esophagus is thought to invoke a compensatory response that gives rise to Barrett's metaplasia, in which squamous cells are gradually replaced by columnar cells.Although a small proportion of patients with Barrett's metaplasia eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma, the condition is considered a precursor for this adenocarcinoma. In this model, digestive enzymes, including gastric and bile acids, may irritate and cause inflammation on the esophagus, leading to hyperproliferation of columnar cells less vulnerable to refluxate, constituting the first \"hit.\" This may eventually lead to low-grade and then premalignant, high-grade dysplastic changes in the esophagus, which in turn may lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This hypothesis is consistent with the multistep process of carcinogenesis [22]. Some epidemiological evidence implicates obesity in the etiology of Barrett's metaplasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, as reviewed next.\n",

      "A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify epidemiological studies that examined obesity or overweight status in relation to: (1) esophageal adenocarcinoma; (2) the closely related tumor, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma: (3) the precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus; and (4) gastroesophageal reflux disease. A computerized search of English language publications was performed up to June 2004 using MEDLINE online database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) as well as manual searches of abstract lists for recent cancer or epidemiology conferences and the reference lists of all relevant articles. Most articles evaluated the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus separately from those of the gastric cardia; however. some early studies combined the two anatomical subtypes together in a single outcome group because of the belief that the two share a common etiology. Whether this latter assumption is correct remains unresolved.  \n",
      "The standard clinical and epidemiological assessment of obesity, weight for height or BMI, was used in many of the studies identified for this review. The World Health Organization defines a BMI of 25 kg/m² or greater as overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m² as obese [23]. Circumferences of the hip and waist have traditionally been used to estimate fat distribution in epidemiological  \n",
      "studies. Centralized obesity, as assessed by the waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio, has been shown to be associated strongly with adult weight gain [24]. Although the validity of each of these measures remains an active topic of investigation, the test and retest reliability of BMI with total body fat and waist-to-hip ratio with central obesity and visceral adipose tissue accumulation are high [24]. Central obesity, which represents an aberrant fat accumulation, may be as important as BMI and may be a more potent adiposity phenotype and a better predictor of chronic disease.\n",

      "Table 18.1 summarizes results from 13 case-control studies and one cohort study that investigated the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma risk and obesity [15-18,25-33]. The investigations were conducted between 1986 and 2001 in a variety of Western countries, including the U.S., Sweden, Norway, Italy, Great Britain, and Germany. Most studies estimated obesity using BMI, which was calculated based on the study participants' recall of usual adult weight, defined as weight ranging from 1 to 20 years prior to the study interview. Weight at specific ages, such as 20 or 40 years of age, was also based on recall. Height, measured or self-reported at interview following disease onset, together with recalled weight, was commonly used to compute BMI.  \n",
      "Using BMI 1 year prior to the interview as a proxy for usual BMI, all [15-18,26,27,30-33] but three studies [25,28,29] reported a dose-dependent increase in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in relation to obesity. The estimates of the magnitude of the association ranged from an odds ratio (OR) of 2.5 to 3.1, when individuals in the lowest quartile of usual or current BMI were compared to those in the highest quartiles. Although fourfold increases in risk were also reported among German men [33], these findings were based on a small number of cases. The two- to threefold increase in risk varied little across populations, despite different cut-points, suggesting perhaps that the relative fat deposits, and not absolute cut-point values of BMI, are important.  \n",
      "The timing of obesity relative to the onset of esophageal adenocarcinoma also appeared to influence risk. When the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and BMI at specific ages, such as BMI at age 20 [17], was evaluated, the magnitude of the association between obesity and esophageal adenocarcinoma was even stronger. In a Swedish case-control study, Lagergren [17] reported a 16-fold increase in risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus among individuals with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m² some 20 years before the interview, when compared to those with a BMI less than 22 kg/m2. The significance of these findings is unclear because others [16] have reported that the magnitude of the association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity at age 20 or at age 40 years was similar; however, the association was slightly stronger among subjects who reported obesity at age 20 than among those who were obese at age 40. One interpretation of these findings is that the duration of obesity during adulthood, rather than obesity in the period surrounding diagnosis, may be the important factor in the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  \n",
      "Few studies evaluated duration of obesity directly, and instead relied on participants to recall weight at different ages to estimate duration. A very strong association between duration of obesity and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was found among British women [31], although the highest quartile included those with a BMI of <23 kg/m². Confirming these results, Chak [32] reported a dose-dependent increase in risk with increasing duration of obesity. However, in these studies [31,32], the number of cases involved was small and estimates were imprecise.  \n",
      "Although most studies combined men and women in the final analyses, studies that provided results stratified by sex suggest that obesity may have a less detrimental effect among women than among men, although these findings are not consistent. In a cohort study, Tretli [18] reported a more than twofold increase in risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma among men in the fourth BMI quartile and no evidence of such an association in women. In the British study that included only women, however, BMI at age 20 was associated with a more than sixfold increase in esophageal\n",

      "The few studies unable to document an association with obesity were hospital based [29], or combined adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia with those of the esophagus to form a single outcome group [25,26]. Because obesity is associated with many chronic conditions, the prevalence of obesity among hospital-based controls may be higher than that in the general population. Thus, case-control studies that utilize hospital-based controls in an investigation of obesity would be expected to underestimate an association. In addition, due to the anatomical proximity of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, the earlier studies presented findings from analyses that combined these as a single disease endpoint [25,26]. Collapsing the two tumors into a single outcome may increase statistical power; however, the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma may be distinct from those of the gastric cardia. Thus, if the relation with obesity varies by anatomical subtype, findings from studies combining the two could be misleading. It is therefore not surprising that, of the three studies that combined anatomical sites or used hospital-based controls, only one [26] found statistically significant differences in obesity between cases and controls.\n",

      "These epidemiological studies usually included assessment of BMI at interview, or relied on an estimate of usual adult BMI, which was commonly based on self-reported weight in the year prior to the interview. In some studies, participants were also asked to recall their weight at age 20 or 40 years or 20 years prior to the interview; thus, estimates of adult weight change could also be calculated.  \n",
      "In studies that evaluated duration, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma increased with time since the participant was first obese. The magnitude of the association for an increased BMI 1 year prior to the interview was weak to moderate, whereas the magnitude in relation to increased BMI some 20 to 50 years prior to disease onset was moderate to strong [16,17]. Compared to individuals in the lowest quartile of BMI 1 year prior to the interview [16], those in the highest category of BMI were at 60% increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. BMI at age 40 years [16] or 20 years prior to the interview [17] was associated with two- to threefold increase in risk. Recalled usual BMI was associated with up to a fourfold increase in risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in men, suggesting that prolonged periods of central obesity in adulthood may be etiologically linked to these tumors. As would be expected if the association was causal, duration of obesity during the course of adulthood appears important.  \n",
      "Most, but not all, studies found that the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma associated with obesity varied by sex. In a generally lean Chinese population-based case-control study, Ji and colleagues [21] reported up to sixfold increased risk of gastric cardia cancers associated with increasing BMI, but the association was stronger among men than women. As with esophageal adenocarcinoma, weight change during adulthood was not associated with increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma [15].  \n",
      "Although theses studies show a positive association between obesity and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, particularly among men, a limitation among them is that body fat was more commonly assessed using BMI rather than the more pertinent waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Central obesity is more common in men and is more relevant to the postulated hypothesis of intra-abdominal pressure. However, estimates of central obesity are particularly difficult to obtain accurately and reliably in a case-control study. Future studies may benefit from inquiring retrospectively about waist and hip circumference using proxy measures such as clothing size, similar to breast cancer studies that include assessment of brassiere size. Although precise estimates could not be obtained from such an inquiry, the relative measure and duration could be evaluated.\n",

      "Table 18.3 summarizes the results from four studies evaluating the association between obesity and Barrett's esophagus that were conducted in the U.S. and the U.K. [34-37]. In these studies, obesity was estimated using BMI, weight, weight change, and waist-to-hip ratio. In a British cross-sectional study of Barrett's esophagus patients, Caygill [34] reported a strong association with high BMI among patients younger than 50 years, but this association was not apparent among patients 50 years and older. These findings were corroborated in a study based on 51 Barrett's esophagus patients that was conducted by Moe [35]. The authors [35] found that diet and nutritional status were associated with elevated cell proliferative fractions in patients. Among these patients, 45% of cases had a high BMI (>27.6 kg/m²) and elevated waist-to-hip ratio was significantly associated with the mean and maximum %S phase cells. Weight change was also associated with the mean and maximum percentage of cells in the G2 phase.  \n",

      "Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity increases the risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adecarcinoma by acting early and influencing risk of Barrett's esophagus. Although this cascade of events may be initiated by intra-abdominal pressure, it might also occur through alteration of growth factors, hormones, or metabolic factors that regulate cell growth [20]. Abdominal obesity is associated with hyperinsulinemia, leptin, and free fatty acids [20]. Insulin also affects the levels of circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding protein. Association studies relating these factors to Barrett's esophagus are currently underway [37].  \n",
      "Obesity's effects may act early in the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, possibly by increasing risk of hiatal hernia and subsequent gastroesophageal reflux disease [38,39]. Obesity has also been associated with cell cycle abnormalities assessed using content flow cytometry to estimate the proportion of proliferating cells, fraction of cells in each phase of the cell cycle (GO, G1, S, and G2). Also, the presence of aneuploid cell populations is more common among patients with Barrett's esophagus compared to otherwise healthy individuals [37]. Recent studies [37,40] have reported an association between genetic and cell cycle abnormalities, including aneploidy (OR = 4.3) and loss of heterozygosity on 9p and 17p (OR = 3.9), in relation to increased central obesity as measured by waist-to-hip ratio. In one of these studies [37], women had on average a larger BMI (mean = 28.9); however, their waist-to-hip ratio was lower (0.87 vs. 0.97). This may  \n",
      "explain in part the preponderance of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas among men. These findings also suggest that, in the presence of Barrett's esophagus, fat distribution may be more important than BMI.\n",

      "Table 18.4 summarizes observational and experimental studies evaluating the relationship between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. These studies were conducted in Italy, the U.K., Norway, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. Eight of the ten studies, of which some were randomized clinical trials, reported a moderate to strong dose-dependent increase in risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease among overweight and obese individuals. When compared to those who were in the lowest category of BMI [41-44], individuals at the highest category of BMI had an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease, heartburn, or hiatal hernja.  \n",
      "In a large U.K. population-based cross-sectional study of over 27,000 individuals, a larger BMI was associated with nearly threefold increase in risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, including heartburn and regurgitation, that was independent of confounding factors such as dyspeptic symptoms [41]. In a cross-sectional study of 1524 otherwise healthy individuals, Locke [45] also reported a strong association between gastroesophageal reflux disease and BMI. NHANES 1 follow-up data of nearly 20 years showed that hospitalization for gastroesophageal reflux disease was related to BMI [44]. Most importantly, a British study [46] found that, among obese patients who lost an average of 4 kg. gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were reduced significantly. These latter findings have since been confirmed in another investigation in which a higher frequency of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction and gastroesophageal reflux disease was found among patients who remained obese, compared to those who lost weight during the 8-month study period [43].  \n",
      "The association between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease has not been found in all studies, however, including several large population-based studies and randomized clinical trials [29.47.48]. Among a Swedish population [47], no significant changes in gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were noted after an average weight loss of more than 9 kg.  \n",
      "A limitation in the interpretation of these findings is that none of the studies evaluated the role of central obesity as measured by waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. The timing of the relevant exposure period varies across studies, with some assessing obesity at diagnosis and others assessing obesity at varying adult ages. Furthermore, the randomized clinical trials [43.46.47] evaluated the effect of obesity on gastroesophageal reflux disease predominantly among the morbidly obese, making generalizability difficult. Despite these shortcomings, on the whole, these studies suggest that obesity increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n",

      "The available epidemiological evidence suggests a positive association between obesity and the risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, as well as with the precursors, including Barrett's metaplasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. As would be expected if the association were causal, this association increases with severity and duration of obesity. It also appears to be more common among men than women, suggesting that central obesity may be the important factor.  \n",
      "The mechanism underlying the association between obesity and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia is unknown; however, several competing hypotheses have been proposed. One is that obesity exacerbates gastroesophageal reflux disease through increased intra-abdominal pressure [50] and the subsequent development of hiatal hernia [51]. More characteristic of Western populations, mechanical pressure from central obesity is exacerbated by tight belts [52] and is hypothesized to give rise to the encroachment of columnar metaplasia, a compensatory response to the corrosive effects of digestive enzymes, including gastric and bile acids.

      "of columnar epithelium (Barrett's esophagus) is a recognized precursor for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. This model is compatible with the multistep process of carcinogenesis, in which central obesity and then gastroesophageal disease are the initial steps that may be followed by the development of low-grade and then high-grade dysplastic changes in the gastrointestinal tract. This hypothesis is also compatible with disease preponderance among men. However, it does not explain the lower incidence among African American men who have a larger body size [7].  \n",
      "Overweight status and obesity are a result of energy balance stores that are too large compared to energy output. Obesity results from high energy intake or low expenditure, or both, and reflects an interplay between heritable genetic factors involved in growth, and environmental factors that may alter endocrine function, including secretion of insulin, sex steroid, and growth hormone [53]. Approximately 25% of obesity can be attributed to genetic factors [54], although the precise loci involved are unknown. The most atherogenic fat deposit of the human body is thought to be in the abdominal cavity, around the viscera, particularly the fat deposits with small blood vessels draining into the portal vein that carries blood back to the liver [24]. This hypothesis is supported by findings that men, who tend to have a large waist circumference, are at greater risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas compared to women, in whom excess fat is predominantly deposited on thighs and buttocks.  \n",
      "First proposed by Mercer [55], the prolonged esophageal transit time observed for solid foods is longer, on average, in obese persons compared to lean individuals. This could theoretically increase contact time for carcinogens present in food. Mercer [56] reported observing a significantly longer esophageal transit time among obese individuals compared to lean patients, even though both patient groups had been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, the authors did not provide usual food types consumed or their composition to enable speculation on possible carcinogens that may have been involved. Some evidence suggests a slower transit time for foods with a high fat content compared to those without it, so disease risk may be associated with dietary fat rather than transit time. Testing this hypothesis has not received much attention because differences in the duration of exposure to any given carcinogen is probably marginal during swallowing.  \n",
      "Another hypothesis posited is that of increased cell proliferation [57] and inhibition of apoptosis. Elevated IGF circulating levels may enhance cell proliferation, resulting in a larger than normal number of cell divisions and increased opportunities for genetic accidents [58]. Also, because insulin-like growth factors inhibit apoptosis, the probability of survival of cells with the \"single hit\" is increased, thus increasing the pool of cells available for subsequent \"hits\" and consequent transformation. Elevated circulating levels of insulin-like growth factors may also influence the probability of progression to clinically apparent or aggressive disease.  \n",
      "Obese individuals are characterized by insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and increased production of insulin-like growth factors [59]. A recent study on the oversecretion of IGF-I and IGF-II in gastric cancer cells [60] reported that the major binding protein, IGFBP-3, was secreted only in approximately half of the cells. Inoculation of cells with IGF-I and IGF-II resulted in proliferation. Elevated levels of IGF-I have been associated with increased risk of cancers of the breast in younger women [61-64], prostate [65-70], and colon [71-73]. Elevated levels of IGFBP-3, relative to IGF-I, have also been associated with decreased risk of breast and prostate cancer.  \n",
      "In addition, IGF-II has been implicated in the paracrine growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cells in vitro [74]. Dose-dependent, two- to threefold increases in risk have also been reported with colorectal cancer among individuals with elevated IGF-II levels [71,75], although the relationships failed to achieve statistical significance. Intra-abdominal fat stores may act as the first \"hit\" by altering metabolism of insulin, increasing generalized proliferative response as a result of elevated insulin or IGF levels. IGFs may also inhibit apoptosis so that the theoretical probability of survival of cells with a single hit is increased, thus increasing the pool of cells available for subsequent hits and consequent transformation. However, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia or elevated IGF levels is unknown and, although the contribution of hyperinsulinemia to esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas has been speculated about widely, this remains unknown.  \n",
      "Excess body fat may also increase risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by modifying the effect of a yet unidentified environmental carcinogen. If such an agent were sequestered in fat tissue, body fat could be associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on this hypothesis, differences in risk among various subpopulations could therefore reflect differences in the intensity and duration of obesity. This hypothesis remains intriguing, despite the lack of data to support it, because of its potential to explain racial differences in disease risk. For example, although obesity is a plausible underlying cause of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia, it is still unclear why incidence differs markedly between African Americans and whites living in the U.S., given that recent national data suggest that African American men have a higher BMI than white men do [7]. Of note, however is that abdominal visceral adiposity rather than overall size by BMI may explain, in part, racial differences in risk of these adenocarcinomas. Recent evidence suggests that, at a given BMI, white males and females have a higher waist circumference than African Americans and, presumably, visceral fat [76].  \n",
      "DNA damage caused by a mixture of environmental exposures may require the base excision or strand break repair. In epidemiological and animal studies, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are associated with increased obesity, and weight loss among the morbidly obese decreases oxidative stress and increases antioxidant activity [77]. Base excision repair targets DNA damage associated with oxidative stress, although it may also repair strand breaks and nonbulky adducts induced by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation and tobacco smoke [78]. Carcinogen-induced DNA damage and cellular damage induced by inflammation during hyperkeritization may play a role in the carcinogenesis of the esophagus and gastric cardia. The precise mechanism involved in obesity and oxidative stress is complex; however, the insulin resistance common in obesity is associated with oxidative stress in humans [79,80].  \n",
      "DNA repair capacity is variable in human populations and a part of that variation is believed to be genetic. A reduction in efficiency of any one pathway may increase risk of replicating damaged or transformed cells. DNA repair capacity has been evaluated by comparing polymorphisms in base excision and nucleotide excision repair pathways in relation to risk of cancers of the breast [81,82], prostate [83,84], lung [85,86], skin [87], and head and neck [88]. In vitro studies of other adenocarcinomas, including pancreatic and prostate tissue, have shown that DNA adducts form after exposure to environmental toxins [89,90] and intake of diets with antioxidative properties has been shown to decrease prostate cancer risk through inactivation of reactive oxygen species [91]. In support of this hypothesis, Brown [26] reported an inverse association between increased fiber intake and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. To date, no studies have evaluated whether DNA repair capacity may play an important role in the development of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.  \n",
      "A suboptimal ability to mount a cellular immune response has been implicated in the development of several adenocarcinomas and has also been associated with obesity [92]. Several animal studies have also linked obesity with impaired immune response [93,94]. Cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators have been implicated in inflammatory Barrett's metaplasia [95]. Cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors have various biological functions, including the inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Proinflammatory chemokines and their receptors are expressed in esophageal and gastric cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells within esophageal tumors. Proinflammatory gene polymorphisms in combination with proinflammatory conditions exacerbated by obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, accompanied by sloughing of basal cells, hyperkeratinization and hyperproliferation, may influence the development of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma.  \n",
      "Humoral immunity in tissue found in the gastrointestinal tract is characterized by the production of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and the CC chemokines CCR2, CCR4, and CCR9 are expressed by esophageal and intestinal epithelial cells [96]. Solid tumor and leukemic cells expressing chemokine receptors have been shown to metastasize to chemokine-secreting organs [96,97]. Chemokines may indirectly affect tumor development by attracting immunocompetent cells with pro- or antitumoral activities. Chemokine receptors mediate the migration of lymphocytes through the binding of ligands, and the expression is differentially regulated in lymphocyte subsets.  \n",
      "Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-alpha and gamma are also known potent immune modulators that can inhibit or enhance immune cell activity within the tightly regulated microenvironment of inflammation, depending upon the concentration of the cytokine and the activation stage of the cell. Among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, increases in several cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-alpha-2b, CC chemokines CXR3, CCR7, and CXR4, were shown to increase with increasing disease severity [98]. Animals deficient in CCR4 and CCR9 have also shown a reduced IgA immune response [99]. CCR9 has been identified as the chemokine receptor regulating lymphocyte trafficking during T-cell development and in mucosal immunity [100].\n",

      "The incidence of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas has been increasing rapidly in the last 30 years, and the etiology of these adenocarcinomas is not fully understood. The temporal, gender, and geographic variation for adenocarcinomas of gastric cardia and esophagus, together with suggestions of familial aggregation of these adenocarcinomas, suggests the importance of environmental factors whose intensity of exposure has increased in the last 30 to 40 years. Obesity has been associated with esophageal and gastric cardia risk as well as its precursors, including Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If causally related, obesity may act early in carcinogenesis through increased intra-abdominal pressure, followed by gastroesophageal reflux disease, the deregulation of the cell cycle, Barrett's esophagus, and the dysplasia, and eventually leading to adenocarcinoma.  \n",
      "The lower incidence among women, despite a similar prevalence of obesity in specific subpopulations, and the high prevalence of adenocarcinomas in geographic regions where the prevalence of obesity is moderate suggest that central obesity, more frequently occurring in men, may be the important factor in the etiology of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. However, correlates of central obesity, such as waist-to-hip ratio and weight gain, have not been consistently linked to risk of these tumors. Whether this is due to the challenges associated with accurately assessing these latter measures in epidemiological research, particularly using a case-control design, needs to be clarified. Furthermore, if obesity is causally related to gastric cardia and esophageal adenocarcinomas, the lower risk of cancer among African Americans, who generally have a higher prevalence of obesity, needs to be reconciled. Molecular epidemiological studies of esophageal cancer may help to elucidate these issues.  \n",
      "Assessment of obesity in epidemiological research is subject to misclassification, and may vary by gender, in that women may under-report and men may over-report body size. Consistent with this possibility, such misclassification would result in an overestimation of the risk associated with  \n",
      "obesity among men and an underestimation of risk among women. Although long-term cohort studies would be ideal, determining the role of obesity in the development of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia can be achieved by carefully designed, population-based, casecontrol studies. Disentangling the effects of obesity from other competing factors will require studies to capture retrospectively fat distribution parameters and changes in these parameters over time during adulthood.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity increase risk for the development of several types of cancer, including postmenopausal breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, lower esophagus, pancreas, and, perhaps, ovary and thyroid cancers [1]. Once individuals develop cancer, depending on the site, they may be at increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival if they are overweight or obese. Several potential mechanisms might explain the link between increased adiposity and increased cancer risk, including hormonal, inflammatory, and immune system effects. This chapter reviews the scientific literature on the association between excess adiposity and sex hormone concentrations in women and men.\n",

      "Adipose tissue constitutes an active endocrine and metabolic organ that can have far-reaching effects on the physiology of other tissues [2]. In response to endocrine and metabolic signals from other organs, adipose tissue responds by increases or decreases in the release of free fatty acids - an energy-providing fuel for skeletal muscle and other tissues. It plays an active role in the regulation of energy balance and lipid metabolism through the release of several peptide hormones, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Increased adipose tissue release of free fatty acids, resistin, and TNFcx, as well as reduced release of adiponectin, in turn give rise to insulin resistance - a metabolic state characterized by reduced metabolic response of tissues (muscle, liver, adipose) to insulin - and to compensatory hyperinsulinemia [3,4].  \n",
      "In addition to its role in regulating energy balance, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue expresses various steroid hormone metabolizing enzymes and, especially in postmenopausal women and men, is an important source of circulating estrogens (Table 19.1).\n",

      "Epidemiological studies have provided substantial evidence that adiposity-induced alterations in circulating levels of sex steroids could in large part explain the associations observed between anthropometric indices of excess weight and risks of cancers of the breast (postmenopasual women only) and endometrium pre- and postmenopasual women) [1]. For these two tissue types, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence also indicates the central role of estrogens, androgens, and progesterone in regulating cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis induction [5-7].  \n",
      "A recent combined analysis of nested case-control data from nine cohort studies, with data from 663 breast cancer cases and 1765 women without breast cancer, showed that postmenopausal women with elevated estrogen or androgen levels have increased risk for developing breast cancer [8]. Women with blood hormone concentrations in the top quintile for estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were approximately twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with women with serum hormones in the bottom quintile, and the trends were highly statistically significant. Furthermore, risk was inversely related to blood levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) [8,9].  \n",
      "Further analyses of these nine pooled cohort studies indicated that the association of body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) with breast cancer risk could be attributed almost entirely to increasing blood levels of total or bioavailable estradiol with increasing BMI [10]. Taken together, these studies indicate that much, if not all, of the BMI-breast cancer relationship can be explained by the adiposity-related increase in endogenous estrogen levels.  \n",
      "Further evidence that increased estrogen levels may underlie the association between BMI and breast cancer comes from studies of menopausal hormone therapy. BMI is more strongly related to risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women who have never used menopausal hormone therapy, compared to women who did use these hormones [11-15]. A likely interpretation of this is that only among women whose levels of estrogens are low (i.e., after menopause, and among nonusers of menopausal hormone therapy) does increased adiposity lead to a rise in breast cancer risk, but not among women whose circulating estrogens are already high due to menopausal hormone therapy use. Finally, mortality is higher among heavier women with breast cancer than  \n",
      "among leaner women, and some studies indicate that the association of elevated BMI with poorer prognosis is more pronounced among women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors [17-19].  \n",
      "With regard to endometrial cancer, a number of case-control studies [20] and prospective studies [21,22] have shown increased cancer risks among pre- and postmenopausal women who have comparatively low plasma levels of SHBG and high levels of the androgens Δ4-androstenedione and testosterone. In one prospective study, risk was also found to be directly related to postmenopausal serum levels of estrone and total and bioavailable estradiol [20,21] with estimated relative risks up to about 5.0 for women in the upper quartiles or quintiles of estradiol levels [21]. In premenopausal women, endometrial cancer risk is also elevated among women with polycystic ovary syndrome [20], which often develops together with, and in large extent as a consequence of, chronic hyperinsulinemia and is generally related to progesterone deficiency.  \n",
      "These various relationships all fit a coherent physiologic model in line with the \"unopposed estrogen\" theory and endometrial cancer [20,23,24]. This widely accepted theory is based on a diverse body of evidence, including the association between endometrial cancer and the use of unopposed estrogen therapy. It stipulates that endometrial cancer development is enhanced by the mitogenic effects of estrogens when these are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone.  \n",
      "Among men, prostate cancer development is also thought to be related to endogenous hormone metabolism, such as by androgen production [25-28]. However, excess weight does not appear to be a key risk factor for prostate cancer, with the possible exception of advanced disease. Indeed, one hypothesis is that obese men, who have high estrogen and low testosterone levels compared with lighter weight men, may have lower risk of prostate cancer due to these hormonal imbalances [29]. Furthermore, risk for prostate cancer is not consistently associated with increase in circulating total or bioavailable testosterone, or other androgens [26-28]. One prospective cohort study suggests that men with high estradiol levels and men with low testosterone levels may be at reduced risk for prostate cancer [28].\n",

      "Estrogens can promote growth of several hormone-dependent tumors, particularly breast and endometrium; conversely, antiestrogens or withdrawal of endogenous estrogens are effective adjuvant treatments for breast cancer [30,31]. Postmenopausal women produce estrogens in fat and other tissue through the aromatization of androgens to estrogens [32,33]. The enzyme aromatase is abundantly present in adipose tissue, especially subcutaneous fat. Estrogens are tumor promoters in vitro and in vivo, and women with high circulating levels of estrogens are at increased risk of developing breast cancer [8].  \n",
      "After menopause, the ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone ceases, but the production of various androgens continues. Most women continue to have detectable concentrations of circulating estrogen after menopause, however; the most prevalent is estrone [32]. After menopause, estrone is produced predominantly through the peripheral conversion, mostly in adipose tissue of adrenal androstenedione [33]. Estradiol, the most metabolically active of the estrogens, is produced in postmenopausal women through the reduction of estrone and the aromatization of ovarian and adrenal testosterone. In postmenopausal women, about 55% of circulating estradiol is bound to SHBG, whereas only a small fraction (2 to 3%) circulates in the \"free\" (unbound) state; most of the remainder is bound to albumin (45%) [34]. The free and albumin-bound fractions can diffuse from the circulation toward target tissues, and is termed \"bioavailable\" estradiol. Testosterone is produced in postmenopausal women in the ovaries and adrenals; women who have had bilateral oophorectomies have lower concentrations of testosterone compared with women with intact ovaries [35].  \n",
      "Several cross-sectional epidemiological studies have found that postmenopausal women who are overweight or obese have elevated concentrations of estrogens compared with lighter weight women. Researchers in the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study investigated the relationship between plasma concentrations of estradiol and SHBG and breast cancer risk factors in 456 healthy postmenopausal women [36]. Increased adiposity was directly associated with increased estradiol and decreased SHBG concentrations (both p trend < 0.001). Women whose BMI was more than 27.5 kg/m2 had a mean estradiol concentration that was almost two times greater than that of women whose BMI was less than 20 kg/m2. The greatest increase in estradiol concentration was observed between those with BMI greater than 27.5 kg/m2 compared with those with BMI lower than this level. SHBG concentrations were also negatively associated with increasing tertile of waist-to-hip ratio (p trend < 0.001).  \n",
      "In a study of 420 postmenopausal women without cancer in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, BMI, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were positively associated with concentrations of estrone and estradiol and significantly negatively associated with SHBG concentrations, although not all of the associations were statistically significant [37]. A cross-sectional analysis of 443 postmenopausal women in New York, Sweden, and Italy found that increased adiposity was significantly positively associated with estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol [38]. SHBG was significantly negatively associated with BMI. In a subsample of 217 participants in the Nurses Health Study, BMI was positively associated with plasma concentrations of estrogens, with multivariate-adjusted correlations ranging from 0.37 for estrone and estrone sulfate to 0.63 for bioavailable estradiol, with all p ≤ 0.01 [39].  \n",
      "In a cross-sectional study of 144 healthy postmenopausal Chinese women, estrone and estradiol levels increased with high BMI; the respective levels were 41% (two-sided P = 0.02) and 17% higher (P = 0.34) among women in the highest BMI category (BMI 24) compared with those in the lowest category (BMI < 20) [40]. In a study of 663 postmenopausal women with and without impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type-2 diabetes from the Rancho Bernardo Study, those with a BMI ≥ 27 had higher serum estradiol (27.6 vs. 21.2 pmol/l) and bioavailable estradiol (16.3 vs. 11.1 pmol/l, p ≤ 0.001) compared with leaner men [41]. Women with a waistto-hip ratio of 0.85 or greater had statistically significantly higher levels of estradiol (24.2 vs. 22.5 pmol/1, p ≤ 0.05) and bioavailable estradiol (13.6 vs. 12.1 pmol/l, p ≤ 0.05). Several other crosssectional studies have also found a positive association between increased adiposity and increased levels of estrogen and decreased levels of SHBG in healthy postmenopausal women [42–49].  \n",
      "Adiposity has also been found to be similarly related to sex hormone blood concentrations in breast cancer patients [50,51]. In a population-based cohort of 505 postmenopausal women with Stage 0-3a breast cancer (the Health, Eating, Activity, Lifestyle [HEAL] Study), adiposity was positively and statistically significantly associated with circulating levels of estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol (Figure 19.1 through Figure 19.3) [50]. Women were identified to this study through the SEER cancer registries of Western Washington and New Mexico and were primarily non-Hispanic and Hispanic whites. Between 4 and 12 months after diagnosis, anthropometric measures and blood draws were obtained on all women and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were obtained on 415 women. Obese women (BMI ≥ 30) had 35% higher concentrations of estrone and 130% higher concentrations of estradiol, compared with lighter women (BMI < 22.0) (p trend, 0.005 and 0.002, respectively). Similar associations were observed for DEXA-derived body fat mass and percent body fat, and waist circumference. Concentrations of free estradiol were doubled to tripled in overweight and obese women compared with lighter weight women (p trend = 0.0001).  \n",
      "Further evidence of an association between adipose tissue stores and circulating estrogen concentrations comes from intervention studies resulting in fat loss. Wu et al. conducted a metaanalysis of low-fat dietary intervention studies, of which four were in postmenopausal women [52]. None of the data in these publications included randomized controls. Three of the four studies found significant reductions in estradiol level after 3 weeks to 5 months of intervention. All of these three interventions also produced weight loss, ranging from 1.4 to 3.4 kg [53-55]. In the one  \n",

      "study that did not produce weight loss, estradiol levels increased after 2 months [56]. Therefore, a reasonable question remains of whether the change in estradiol was due to the dietary fat change or to the loss of adipose tissue.  \n",
      "Exercise-induced fat loss also results in reductions in circulating estrogens. In the Physical Activity for Total Health Study (a randomized controlled clinical trial in 173 postmenopausal, sedentary, overweight/obese women), a 1-year moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program (45 minutes/day, 5 days/week) produced statistically significant reductions in estrogens. The effect was limited to women who lost body fat: women whose percentage of body fat (DEXA) decreased by >2% had statistically significant (comparing exercisers vs. controls) decreases at 12 months of 11.9, 13.7, and 16.7% for serum estrone, estradiol, and free estradiol, respectively [57].\n",

      "In men, estradiol is produced primarily through tissue aromatization of testosterone, and estrone is produce through tissue aromatization of adrenal androstenedione [58]. In overweight and obese men, as in overweight and obese postmenopausal women, increased aromatase activity results in higher circulating levels of estrogens. In a study of 775 men with and without impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type-2 diabetes from the Rancho Bernardo Study, those with a BMI ≥ 27 had slightly higher serum estradiol (75.8 vs. 74.4 pmol/l) and bioavailable estradiol (49.8 vs. 46.4 pmol/1, p ≤ 0.001) compared with leaner men [41]. Other large cross-sectional studies have also shown direct correlations of BMI with serum levels of estrone and estradiol in men [59-61].\n",

      "Adiposity influences the synthesis and bioavailability of endogenous sex steroids (estrogens, androgens, progesterone) (Table 19.1) through at least three mechanisms. First, adipose tissue expresses a variety of sex steroid metabolizing enzymes for the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors secreted by the gonads or adrenal glands. In postmenopausal women and in men, adipose tissue is a major site of estrogen synthesis and BMI is directly related to circulating levels of estrone and estradiol as described earlier (Table 19.1) [62-64].  \n",
      "Second, through an increase in circulating insulin, adiposity reduces the hepatic synthesis and blood concentrations of SHBG, a plasmatic binding protein with high specific affinity for testosterone and estradiol [65]. In men and women, adiposity-related decreases in SHBG levels generally increase the fraction of bioavailable estradiol unbound to SHBG. In women only, decreases in SHBG generally also lead to increased levels of bioavailable testosterone [24,62,65,66]. In men, by contrast, decreases in SHBG generally entail reductions in total testicular testosterone production and no increase in bioavailable testosterone [62,66,67].  \n",
      "Finally, elevated insulin has been shown to enhance androgen synthesis in ovarian cell and tissue in vitro [68] and chronic hyperinsulinemia has been strong]y implicated in the development of syndromes of excess ovarian androgen production (polycystic ovary syndrome). The polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by ovarian hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and progesterone deficiency [68-70]; it is a relatively frequent syndrome, with an estimated prevalence of around 4 to 6% of premenopausal women. In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, fasting serum insulin levels are directly correlated with serum androgen concentrations, but in normoandrogenic women, such correlation has not generally been observed [24]. Nevertheless, because of reductions in serum SHBG, insulin levels do generally correlate positively with levels of bioavailable testosterone, unbound to SHBG, in women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome.\n",

      "Overweight, obese, and sedentary postmenopausal women have elevated concentrations of circulating total and free androgens, which may be due to increased amounts of 178-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. A combined analysis of nested case-control studies within nine cohort studies, which included data from 663 breast cancer cases and 1765 women without breast cancer, found that postmenopausal women with serum hormone concentrations in the top quintile for testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, and DHEAS were approximately twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with women with serum hormones in the bottom quintile [8]. In the same analysis, a doubling of androgen concentration resulted in a 20 to 40% increase in risk for breast cancer.  \n",
      "When estradiol and testosterone were included in the same model, the effect of doubling of testosterone on breast cancer risk was greater than that of estradiol (RR 1.32 and 1.18, respectively), and similar results were observed for androstenedione when combined in a model with estradiol. These androgens may increase cell proliferation by being converted to estradiol and estrone in the circulation or target tissue. In addition, androgens may affect breast cancer risk by directly stimulating the growth and division of breast cells.  \n",
      "In the cross-sectional analysis of 443 postmenopausal women in New York, Sweden, and Italy described earlier, increased adiposity was positively associated with bioavailable testosterone (p trend = 0.009), free testosterone, (p trend < 0.001), androstenedione (p trend = 0.01), and DHEAS (p trend = 0.13) [38]. In the study of 420 postmenopausal women without cancer in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, BMI, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were positively associated with concentrations of testosterone, although the associations were not statistically significant. The greatest effect of adiposity on testosterone level appeared to be in the women whose BMI was greater than 25.8 vs. lighter weight women. In that same study, concentrations of DHEAS rose slightly but nonstatistically significantly with increasing measures of adiposity [37].  \n",

Both adiposity measures were statistically significantly negatively associated with concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG, although the associations with free testosterone were weak. The lowest concentrations of testosterone and free testosterone were seen in men whose waist circumference was in the highest tertile and whose BMI was in the lowest tertile, e.g., those with the most disproportionate amount of abdominal adiposity.  \n",

Waist-to-hip ratio showed similar, but attenuated, associations [41]. In a population-based random sample of 1241 middle-aged U.S. men, androstenedione, total plasma testosterone, albumin-bound testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and SHBG decreased with increasing quintile of BMI [75].

      "Adipose tissue is a significant source of estrogens for women, especially after menopause. These elevations are significant enough to increase risk for several hormone-related cancers, particularly postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers. These associations are seen in healthy women as well as in women with breast cancer. Overweight and obese women also have elevated circulating androgen concentrations. Preliminary evidence suggests that these elevated hormones can be reversed through weight loss, through diet or exercise, although the exact dietary and exercise patterns most likely to limit excess hormone production are not known. In men, excess adiposity increases circulating estrogens and lowers testosterone, which may be protective against prostate cancer occurrence.\n",

      "An estimated 10 to 40% of cancer cases are attributed to obesity. Excess adipose tissue, a central feature of obesity, increases the release of free fatty acids and certain cytokines, which leads to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Elevated concentrations of insulin result in elevated concentrations of biologically active insulin-like growth factor-1 and, through their respective receptors, both of these factors may contribute to tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation. Fortunately, a few pivotal studies indicate that lifestyle intervention can delay or prevent the onset of tumor growth and metastasis. Reduced caloric intake, adherence to a prudent dietary pattern, and increased physical activity are particularly effective strategies to reverse insulin resistance. Data suggest that implementing these lifestyle intervention strategies may help reduce the risk of chronic disease, including cancer.\n",

      "Obesity is one of the most daunting health challenges of the 21st century.1 An estimated 64% of American adults are overweight or obese.2 Between 1986 and 2000, the prevalence of severe obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m²) quadrupled from 1 in 200 Americans to 1 in 50. Adults with a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m² (superobese) increased by a factor of 5, from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 400.34 Children and adolescents suffered a similar fate. In the last 30 years, the prevalence of overweight children has nearly tripled.5 At present, approximately 9 million children over 6 years of age are considered obese.6 Each year, the U.S. spends an estimated $117 billion in direct and indirect costs on health problems associated with excess weight.7 The health risks of overweight or obesity are second only  \n",
      "to tobacco use as the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.8 Increasing numbers of people recognize that nutrition plays a critical role in maintaining good health and that overweight or obesity is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.  \n",
      "Awareness is growing that excess weight may also increase cancer risk. In fact, an estimated 10 to 40% of cancer cases are attributed to obesity.9 Obesity has been linked to a number of different cancers9-13; the most compelling evidence of an increased risk is seen in studies of esophageal, 4417 kidney, 18-21 endometrial, 22-25 colon, 20-31 and certain breast cancers. 32-35 Obesity may also be associated with pancreatic, 36-38 ovarian, 39-11 and gallbladder42-44 cancers. The relative risks of these obesity-associated cancers are summarized in Table 20.1, based on the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) Handbook of Cancer Prevention; Weight Control and Physical Activity, as published in the Institute of Medicine's recent report on Cancer Prevention and Early Detection.9.45 The association between obesity and prostate cancer is not conclusive, but a few large studies support a statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer in obese men. 46-49\n",

      "Obesity is a complex disorder characterized by the accumulation of excess adipose tissue.50 In Western countries, much of the problem stems from eating \"too much of a bad thing.\" Fueling this unfortunate habit is the current trend toward increased portion sizes and the widespread availability of inexpensive convenience or \"fast\" foods, which are often high in fat and calories. Studies suggest that Americans get 30% of their daily calories from junk food51 (now also called \"foods of minimal nutritional value\" 52  \n",
      "Lack of adequate exercise is the other central problem. Of American adults, 28% lead sedentary lifestyles53; this is intricately linked to obesity.54 Only one-quarter of Americans meet the current recommendations for physical activity, which call for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate activity a day.5556 Improper nutrition, inadequate physical activity, and the resulting increase in body weight are also the root causes of metabolic syndrome, a major health risk factor that precedes cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.57-59 Having at least three of the following five risk factors qualifies an individual for metabolic syndrome (see Table 20.2)60:\n",

Insulin and the structurally homologous insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) reside as a family of growth hormones.62,63 Insulin controls the movement of glucose into muscle cells and suppresses the liver's production of glucose. It also regulates the breakdown of fat cells in adipose tissue. Therefore, skeletal muscle, the liver, and adipose tissue are the main organs affected by insulin resistance.\n",

      "There is good evidence that overweight and obesity can lead to insulin resistance.64,65 Weight gain leads to an increase in adipose tissue and adipocytes. 66 Adipose tissue serves as a storage depot for energy in the form of triglycerides. The size and metabolic activity of adipocytes vary depending  \n",
      "on their location in the body. Compared to subcutaneous adipocytes, abdominal (visceral) adipocytes are characterized by enlarged cells that are less sensitive to insulin-mediated antilypolysis, are more sensitive to catecholamine-induced lipolysis, and display increased metabolic activity via this elevated lypolytic activity and the increased release of free fatty acids.67 Because visceral adipocytes uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, many physicians prefer to use abdominal circumference rather than BMI to assess the severity of potential health risks associated with overweight and obesity.\n",

      "Excess adipose tissue results in the increased concentration of serum free fatty acids, partly due to an impaired inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue.66 During normal lipolysis, adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase, activated by glucagon or epinephrine, hydrolyzes triclycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids, increasing the release of free fatty acids into the blood. Insulin exerts the opposite effect of glucagon by inactivating hormone sensitive lipase, inhibiting the mobilization of fat from adipose tissue. Once released into the blood, free fatty acids must be (1) oxidized (primarily in muscle tissue and the liver) for energy use; or (2) re-esterified to triglycerides in the liver. Failure of these metabolic pathways will result in elevated serum free fatty acids. This is particularly true for individuals with a genetically based impaired lipoprotein lipase, a condition associated with obesity and insulin resistance.69-72 Elevated serum concentrations of free fatty acids inhibit insulinstimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. 73,74\n",

      "Adipose tissue also harbors a warehouse of cytokines, or signaling hormones, that are key to energy regulation,75 including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), resistin, and adiponectin.66 Excess adipose tissue causes an increase in the release of TNF076 and resistin7778 and a decrease in the release of adiponectin. 79,80 These cytokines, particularly TNFox, stimulate the upregulation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. Increased levels of TNFox, derived from increasing numbers of fat cells, particularly in visceral tissue, also increase the release of free fatty acids. This, in turn, increases lipolysis, creating a vicious cycle of more fat cells and more free fatty acids.81 Through these mechanisms, elevated serum levels of free fatty acids, TNFox, and other cytokines impair insulin sensitivity. These elevated serum concentrations of insulin and TNFα also target receptors on cells that promote cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis, leading to tumor development.\n",

      "Because insulin resistance decreases the organs' sensitivity to the actions of insulin, the body compensates by secreting more insulin. Elevated serum concentrations of insulin lead to a state of hyperinsulinemia. Chronic hyperinsulinemia is associated with certain colon,82 breast, 83,84 pancreatic, $5 and endometrial86 cancers. Increased blood levels of insulin cause a reduction in insulin-like growth-factor-binding proteins, resulting in an increase of the metabolically active protein, IGF-1, a molecule that regulates cell proliferation in response to energy from diet and body reserves.11  \n",
      "Insulin's tumorigenic effects may be direct, through signaling via the insulin receptor, or indirect, via insulin's influence on IGF-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF1R), and the steroid hormones.87 Research on certain cancers demonstrates that IGF-1 appears to mediate insulin's ability to promote cell division.88,89 Together, these growth factors promote cell proliferation and inhibit programmed cell death.9091 Through these mechanisms, overweight and obesity lead to insulin resistance, which may promote cancer (Figure 20.1).  \n",
      "FIGURE 20.1 Effects of obesity on growth-factor production. In obesity, increased release from adipose tissue of free fatty acids (FFA), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and resistin, and reduced release of adiponectin lead to the development of insulin resistance and compensatory, chronic hyperinsulinemia. Increased insulin levels, in turn, lead to reduced liver synthesis and blood levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and probably also reduced IGFBP1 synthesis locally in other tissues. Increased fasting levels of insulin in the plasma are generally also associated with reduced levels of IGFBP2 in the blood. This results in increased levels of bioavailable IGF1. Insulin and IGF1 signal through the insulin receptors (IRs) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), respectively, to promote cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in many tissue types. These effects might contribute to tumorigenesis. (From Calle, E.E. and Kaaks, R., Natl Rev Cancer, 4, 579, 2004. With permission from Nature Publishing Group.)\n",

      "Breast cancer, the most common invasive cancer diagnosed among American women, is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Several studies suggest a strong association between breast cancer and insulin resistance; however, more studies are needed to validate a causal relationship.92 Through its negative effect on proper cell functioning, hyperinsulinemia appears to play a role in the etiology of breast cancer. Most breast cancer cells overexpress the insulin receptor93,94 and the IGF-1 receptor,95 that contribute to the pathophysiology of breast cancer.94,96,97 Insulin and IGF-1 regulate cell proliferation via a tyrosine kinase growth factor cascade in breast cancer,88 which may explain evidence of insulin's tumorigenic effects. 88,94,96\n",

      "Obesity is responsible for an estimated 10 to 25% of all breast cancers.98 More than 100 studies have examined the associations between breast cancer risk and weight or BMI, including those looking at weight gain at different ages and location of weight gain (i.e., visceral vs. subcutaneous fat). Taken together, the findings suggest that women who are overweight or obese have a 30 to 50% increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer compared with leaner women. 33,99,100 Furthermore, lifetime weight gain in excess of 9.7 BMI points (as seen in the Women's Health Initiative) or 20 kg (as demonstrated in the Nurses Health Study) was associated with doubling of the risk of breast cancer.  \n",
      "Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, plays a role in the biology of breast cancer by increasing circulating concentrations of androgens, as well as insulin, IGF-I, and other growth factors. Obesity is also associated with steroid hormonal profiles thought to favor breast cancer growth, 101 including higher concentrations of female hormones in postmenopausal women who are estrogen receptor positive and increased risk of breast cancer in women over age 50.  \n",
      "Weight also influences breast cancer survival. Women who are overweight, obese, or gain weight after diagnosis have poorer survival from breast cancer compared with women who maintain an appropriate BMI. 101,102 Race is another important factor. Obesity and obesity-related disorders, including breast cancer, are more prevalent in African American women!03,104 than in their white counterparts, a disparity even more pronounced among middle-aged women (55 vs. 28%, respectively).105 African American women develop breast cancer an average of 10 years earlier than white women.

Hispanic women have a prevalence about 26% higher than that of their male counterparts (Figure 20.2).107 Finally, African American women have poorer outcomes from breast cancer than their white counterparts. These racial disparities in survival may stem from hormonal and genetic differences in African American women that affect their response to breast cancer therapy.106  \n",
      "Tall women and those who experienced rapid growth during adolescence (independent of final height) may also be at increased risk of developing breast cancer.108 In this respect, height and rate of growth in early life potentially may be added to obesity and race as risk factors for developing breast cancer. Because Americans have become taller and fatter over the last four decades109 and both factors may contribute to breast cancer incidence, increasing numbers of the U.S. population are at risk. Fortunately, a few pivotal studies indicate that lifestyle intervention can delay or prevent the onset of tumor growth and metastasis.  \n",

      "The evidence linking breast cancer and dietary fat, particularly saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, was strong enough to warrant intervention through WINS and other studies such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Women's Healthy Eating Lifestyle Study (WHEL). Launched in 1987, WINS is a National Cancer Institute-funded trial investigating the effect of a low-fat diet on the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with stage I and II disease. Participants were randomized to a diet in which 15% of caloric intake is from fat or to a nonintervention group (control diet) in which approximately 30% of caloric intake is from fat.110 All had previously received currently recommended treatment with tamoxifen or chemotherapy. The study required accrual of 2500 participants at 30 participating cancer centers. Recent data from the WINS trial suggest that lifestyle intervention resulting in dietary fat intake reduction may improve the relapsefree survival of postmenopausal breast cancer patients.  \n",
      "In a recent substudy of the WINS trial, 200 subjects were randomly selected from the low-fat diet arm of WINS to reduce their fat intake even further to examine the successful dietary strategies made by these women. Foods were divided into main groups and subgroups based on the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. The most substantial dietary changes made by the women in the strictly adherent low-fat group included a statistically significant decrease in the number of servings of high-fat foods from the following subgroups: sweet breads, snack foods, cheese, red meats, nuts and seeds, and eggs.112 The strictly adherent group appears to have achieved this reduction in fat intake by shifting the number of overall servings consumed from each food group and significantly decreasing servings from the fats/oils/sweets and the bread food groups112 (Table 20.3). Consumption of \"other fruits\" including apples, pears, and bananas increased. Women in the study were able to maintain sufficient nutrient intake while reducing dietary fat.  \n",

      "The WHI is a 15-year exploration of how to prevent coronary heart disease, breast and colon cancer, and fractures from osteoporosis. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the WHI is one of the largest studies of its kind ever undertaken in the U.S. It involves more than 40 centers nationwide and over 162,000 American women aged 50 to 79. Enrollment began in 1993 and ended in 1998. First results of the Dietary Modification Trial are expected in 2006.113  \n",
      "The WHI Dietary Modification Trial is less a test of the dietary fat hypothesis than it is of the impact of a low-fat dietary pattern114 high in fruits, vegetables, and grains on disease prevention. The trial involves approximately 49,000 women followed for 8 to 12 years, who followed their usual eating pattern or a diet low in fat but high in fruits, vegetables, and grains. The modified diet reduces daily fat intake to 20% of total calories, boosts fruits and vegetables to five or more daily servings, and increases grains to six or more daily servings. Structured telephone counseling. supported by print materials and monthly cooking classes, provides the principal instrument for maintaining the intervention.  \n",
      "To examine the associations among physical activity, diet, and insulin more closely, researchers studied a subsample from the WHI participants - 2996 postmenopausal women with no prior cancer history. Dietary intake was determined with a food frequency questionnaire and physical activity by questionnaire with fasting insulin regressed on physical activity and caloric intake. Figure 20.3 shows the differences in insulin levels in each quintile of physical activity and caloric intake, with approximately 120 values in each subgroup. Controlling for body weight, increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake independently (p < 0.001) predicted lower insulin concentrations. These results suggest that it is possible to manipulate and lower insulin levels through common weight loss strategies.  \n",

      "An editorial in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute115 highlights the potential inaccuracy of the food frequency questionnaire (FFO) as an exposure assessment tool in studies associating dietary intake with chronic disease risk. The authors illustrate that nutritional epidemiology involves complex multivariate models, and the measurement error of the instrument could be greatly amplified in this multivariate analysis, confounding associations between dietary intake and disease incidence. This may explain why a protective association between fruit and vegetable intake and cancer incidence was not evident in one study.116 A similar effect was observed in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study, when researchers discovered that an association between saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk was being obscured by the measurement error of the FFO.117  \n",
      "The WINS trial methodology employs a dietary reporting system of serial, unannounced, 24hour dietary recalls over the telephone. Through careful background research and analysis, this measurement tool was found to be more accurate and reliable than the FFQ. 11,118 Dietary intake was assessed by the mean of three recalls (one weekend and two weekdays) using the multiplepass 24-hour recall system previously shown to be useful in this population.119 Women in the low fat diet arm experienced a 24% reduction in recurrence risk over 5 years compared with controls. 111\n",

      "Compliance with \"prudent\" dietary patterns based on current national guidelines is associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases120-122 and is a crucial step in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke.123 The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans124 feature Institute of Medicine reference intakes for macronutrients125 and nine, easy-to-understand key messages for good health. The thrust of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is away from the Western diet, which is higher in saturated fats, red meat, and refined flours, and toward a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. The latter is classified as a prudent dietary pattern. 126,127  \n",
      "In terms of reducing the risk of cancer, the strategy of adhering to a prudent dietary pattern is supported by a study that examined subjects from the Iowa Women's Health Study, suggesting that better compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is linked to a lower risk of cancer.128 Compliance with the \"cluster of nutrition-related behaviors\" recommended by the Dietary Guidelines was associated with a 15% overall reduction in cancer incidence among postmenopausal women in the top quintile of degree of adherence to the guidelines. Those who followed the physical activity, weight control, and diet recommendations cut their risk of cancer by 15%. In so doing, they underscored the power of lifestyle modification to protect middle-aged or older women against cancer.  \n",
      "A wealth of research indicates that diets reduced in calories, low in saturated fats, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains offer a safe, effective way to maintain a healthy body weight. !23 Reduced caloric intake, adherence to a prudent dietary pattern, and increased physical activity are particularly effective weight loss strategies for the obese, insulin-resistant individual.123 Weight loss will result in lower insulin129 and IGF-I130 levels, the reversal of insulin resistance,131,132 and, thus, a reduction of the risk of cancer.119,120,133,134\n",

TNFq. and resistin and reduced release of adiponectin from adipose tissue lead to the development of insulin resistance and compensatory, chronic hyperinsulinemia. Increased insulin concentrations result in increased concentrations of bioavailable IGF-1, which signal through respective receptors to promote cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in a way that might contribute to tumorigenesis.11 Because many cancers do not respond to cancer therapy, it is important to recognize that the risk of developing obesity-associated diseases can be diminished or avoided through lifestyle interventions. Among the crucial factors are  \n",

      "With the advent of inexpensive assays for an ever expanding number of immune system proteins, the field of immunology has grown exponentially over the last few decades. The growth of this field has also been promoted by research implicating immune factors in a variety of chronic diseases. For example, the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as a strong risk factor for the development of future heart attacks and strokes, the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been linked to diabetes, and other cytokines are implicated in clinical depression and the development of certain cancers (Figure 21.1).1 It is unclear at this point which cytokines and other immune measures are potential targets for therapeutic intervention and which are markers of physiological disturbances. Regardless, research is likely to continue to focus on these factors on a variety of fronts for the foreseeable future.\n",

      "The human body's protection system can be divided into two broad categories: innate (nonspecific) and acquired (specific). The acquired immune system is capable of recognizing and eliminating specific foreign microorganisms and molecules. Nonspecific immune events result in inflammation and occur in response to an injury or infection; they comprise local (heat, swelling) and systemic changes. These systemic events, called the acute phase response, are responsible for the release of an array of proteins from the liver called acute phase proteins.2 Classically, the inflammatory response was considered an acute phenomenon designed to limit tissue damage or infection. However, researchers are now focusing on chronic inflammation and inflammatory molecules as playing significant roles in a variety of acute and chronic diseases.  \n",

      "Innate and specific immune responses involve a multitude of cells. The primary channel of communication between these cells in both types of responses is through a group of secreted lowmolecular-weight proteins called cytokines. Previously, cytokines were thought to be involved only with immune functions, but it is now believed that some cytokines interact with the immune and endocrine systems and are constitutively expressed. In general, cytokines bind to receptors on target cells and trigger signaling cascades that alter gene expression in the cells. They have high affinity for their receptors that allows a very small concentration of cytokines to have a significant biological effect.3  \n",
      "The role of cytokines and other inflammatory markers in the immune response and in the endocrine system is difficult to study for many reasons. Cytokines are pleiotropic in nature. One cytokine, for example IL-6, can have multiple effects on multiple cells. Next, cytokine action is often redundant, with two or more cytokines signaling similar cascades. Cytokines often act synergistically; two or more cytokines can have a greater effect than either can alone. Finally, cytokine signaling depends on the presence and availability of cytokine receptors on the cells. Cytokine receptors are highly specific and are found in cell membranes, where they trigger a signal cascade, and also in the bloodstream, where they serve to down-regulate an immune response by binding up floating cytokines.3  \n",
      "Hundreds of cytokines and other inflammatory markers are known and an exhaustive review of each one is beyond the scope of this chapter. Thus, this chapter is limited to well-studied inflammatory markers thought to play a role in obesity and its related comorbidities. A list of commonly studied inflammatory markers, cytokines, and hormones, as well as the type of study in which they were examined, is provided in Table 21.1.\n",

In a number of recent studies, CRP has been reported to be associated positively with BMI.28,30,31,36,38,39,45,50,51 In a study of 2205 women and 1940 men from the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), significant and independent associations existed between CRP concentrations and both waist circumference and BMI.31 In a sample of 61 obese postmenopausal women, Tchernof et al. found plasma CRP levels were positively associated with body weight, BMI, fat-free mass, total fat mass, and the intra-abdominal adipose tissue area.45  \n",
      "Similarly, CRP has been reported to be associated with measures of central adiposity such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and visceral adiposity.24,36,43,50,30,50,50,50,50,50,500,000 Japanese men and women and found CRP to be associated with visceral adiposity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and visceral adipose tissue accumulation) even after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking 43 Forouhi et al. compared South Asian and European men and women. In South Asians, waist girth and visceral fat area were highly associated with CRP. In contrast, in Europeans, BMI and percentage body fat were more significantly associated with CRP.33  \n",
      "In a study of postmenopausal women from the Healthy Women Study, measures of central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio, waist girth, visceral fat) and overall adiposity (BMI, subcutaneous fat, weight, percent body fat) were all associated with CRP levels. Interestingly, CRP levels increased linearly across quartiles of visceral adipose tissue, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.24  \n",
      "Other measures of inflammation, such as IL-6 and TNF-o, have also been examined crosssectionally for association with body composition. In general, the results are similar to those of CRP. IL-6 correlated with measures of obesity in several cross-sectional studies.38,39,44,47,50,52 In a population of 107 healthy men and women, Yudkin et al. found that concentrations of IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α were strongly related to measures of total and central obesity.50 Similarly, TNF-α is associated with obesity in a number of studies. 35,38,50,52  \n",
      "Few cohort studies have specifically investigated the development of obesity and changes in inflammatory markers. One study by Duncan et al. studied weight gain and white blood cell count, fibrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factors in the 13,017 men and women aged 45 to 64 in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort. Adjusted odds of a large weight gain for those in the highest quartile of fibrinogen were 1.65 (95% confidence interval [1.38 to 1.97]) when compared with the lowest quartile. Similar results were found for those in the highest quartile of white blood cell count, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor.54\n",

      "Intervention studies of inflammatory variables and obesity have primarily involved small weight loss trials in obese females (Table 21.2). The most common markers of inflammation studied were CRP, IL-6, and TNF-0. However, other relevant immune parameters and hormones such as leptin, insulin, and resistin have also been examined. Trials have used a variety of weight loss interventions, including exercise, diet, and behavioral modifications, as well as surgical procedures such as liposuction and bariatric surgery. Length of follow-up has varied greatly, from 3 weeks55 to 24 months.56 The majority of the trials were nonrandomized trials without control groups.  \n",
      "When a negative caloric balance is achieved and weight is lost, regardless of type of weight loss intervention, CRP and IL-6 have consistently been shown to decrease35,9,45,56-66 and TNF-cx has decreased33,39,66-68 or remained unchanged.57,60,61,63,69 Hormones such as leptin and insulin consistently decreased with weight loss. 35,57,58,64-66 One of the largest trials of weight loss consisted of 316 sedentary, older (>60) men and women with a follow-up time of 18 months; participants were randomized to a control group or weight loss intervention group. In this study, participants in the diet-induced weight loss group had significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, and soluble TNFR-1 compared to those who had no weight loss treatment.61  \n",
      "In a novel study by Klein et al. published in the New England Journal of Medicine, numerous plasma markers of cardiovascular disease risk were assessed in 15 obese females before and after undergoing abdominal liposuction.69 They found no change in CRP, IL-6. TNF-cx, adiponectin, or insulin levels despite an overall reduction in weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Interestingly, subjects with normal glucose tolerance had a larger reduction in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue compared with those with abnormal glucose tolerance (44 vs. 28%). The volume of abdominal visceral adipose tissue and thigh adipose tissue did not change in either of the groups. This study showed that weight loss through a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue is not sufficient to reduce elevated inflammatory parameters in obese women. In addition, it reinforces the current view that visceral adipose tissue is more active than subcutaneous adipose tissue in the secretion of metabolic and inflammatory parameters.\n",

      "Excess body fat is the result of caloric imbalance and is typically the consequence of too much energy intake and not enough caloric expenditure. An intriguing question that follows from this assumption is whether the relation between inflammation and body fat is due to the excess body fat or the behaviors that lead to it. In other words, is the heightened state of inflammation observed  \n",

      "A number of cross-sectional studies have looked at this issue and it is clear that regular exercise explains a large part of the obesity-inflammation connection.70-77 Many studies have found an inverse relation between regular physical activity (or cardiorespiratory fitness) and markers of systemic inflammation in men and women. However, although the observed fitness-inflammation association is usually only moderately attenuated, if at all, by adjustment for body habitus in men, in women this adjustment often eliminates the fitness-inflammation association. Gender differences in the physical activity-fatness-inflammation relation deserve further research. Current research suggests that systemic inflammation appears to be driven largely by physical activity habits in men (Figure 21.2), but body weight may be the primary driver in women. The source of the gender difference, if indeed one exists, is subject to speculation. However, potential starting points for investigation include location of fat mass (intramuscular, visceral, liver, etc.), effect of hormones (in particular, sex hormones), and stress.  \n",
      "Though not a randomized trial, Milani et al. reported that participation in a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program reduced CRP in individuals with cardiovascular disease (n = 235) compared to no change in a control group (n = 42) of individuals with cardiovascular disease who elected not to participate in cardiac rehabilitation. In the group that attended cardiac rehabilitation, the reduction in CRP was similar in individuals who took statin medications and those who did not, and the reduction in CRP in those that lost weight was similar to that in those who did not (Figure 21.3).10 Currently, no randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trials exist in the literature that are specifically designed to examine the ability of physical activity to reduce inflammation. With the growing importance of inflammatory markers such as CRP as clinical predictors of morbidity, there is a need for well-designed trials that examine the role of exercise in reducing inflammation in men and women from different ethnicities in a variety of populations.  \n",

      "Modern technology has made the measurement of markers of inflammation and cytokines cheap and widely accessible. Many chronic disease conditions are associated with an elevated state of inflammation and, for some conditions, inflammation may be part of the causal pathway. Extensive cross-sectional data demonstrate a strong association between markers of inflammation and measures of body fatness. Furthermore, weight loss intervention studies demonstrate reductions in plasma markers of inflammation with reductions in weight. However, the relative contributions to the development of an elevated state of inflammation of the behaviors responsible for overweight and obesity, such as poor diet and physical inactivity, remain poorly understood. Interventional studies are needed to examine the role of diet, physical activity, and weight loss in reducing inflammation in both genders across a variety of study populations.\n",

      "The prevalence of obesity is increasing at an unprecedented rate [1,2], and the occurrence of this disorder in humans is reported to be associated with an increased risk for a number of chronic diseases, including several types of cancer [3]. The goal of this review is to identify mechanisms that may account for the observed relationship between obesity and the occurrence of cancer. The obese state may affect the clinical characteristics of a carcinoma and/or on cancer treatment outcomes [3]; however, the extrapolation of such effects to understanding how obesity modulates the disease process resulting in cancer may obscure critical relationships and/or generate false leads about candidate mechanisms. Therefore, no consideration will be given to how obesity may affect the characteristics of detected cancers, cancer therapy, or cancer prognosis.  \n",
      "Obesitogenesis is a complex disorder resulting from the chronic misregulation of energy balance that results in obesity. Carcinogenesis also is a multifaceted disease process operationally divided into initiation, promotion, and progression; one particular stage of this disease is cancer. Obesitogenesis and carcinogenesis develop over a period of years. Given their complexity and time frame for occurrence, it is not surprising that the investigation of the relationship between obesity and cancer incidence in human populations is laden with difficulties and that the elucidation of causal mechanisms from such studies is even more problematic.  \n",
      "Animal models for obesitogenesis and carcinogenesis are well established; thus, a significant opportunity exists for experiments using these models to inform clinical understanding about potential cause and effect relationships between these diseases because key variables difficult to control in human populations can be manipulated using animal models. As will be discussed in subsequent sections, available preclinical evidence fails to support a direct relationship between obesity per se, i.e., body fatness and the occurrence of cancer. This observation illustrates the potential for preclinical studies to inform, challenge, and reshape current understanding about two very complex disorders. This chapter will be narrowly focused in order to advance a mechanistic hypothesis about the linkage between obesity and the occurrence of cancer.\n",

      "Obesity is an operationally defined stage in obesitogenesis characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat [4]. Accumulation of energy in the body is due to an excess intake of energy relative to the amount of energy expended, a condition referred to as positive energy balance. In the adult, a lifestyle characterized by chronic positive energy balance leads to the development of overweight and obesity.  \n",
      "In a number of animal studies, models for obesity have been combined with carcinogenesis models to study the effects of obesity on the development of cancer [5–12]. In those experiments. animals ate excessive amounts of diet, usually as the result of a genetic defect that is a component of the obesity model. Over time, sufficient carcass energy was accumulated and the animals were considered obese. At time points after the obese state was attained, cancer endpoints were measured. The majority of studies in which a cancer endpoint was assessed concluded that a higher incidence of cancer occurred in obese animals.  \n",
      "However, in a subset of these studies, an effort was made to determine whether body fatness was the determinant of increased cancer rates; a direct relationship between body fatness and the occurrence of cancer was not found [8-12]. Consistent with these preclinical data, an expert panel on the role of weight control and physical activity in cancer prevention concluded that adult weight gain in excess of 5 kg, not obesity per se, is associated with an increased risk for cancer [3]. This implies that positive energy balance resulting in weight gain rather than obesity per se is a determinant of risk.\n",

      "Although there is a natural tendency to focus on the relationship between obesity per se and the development of cancer, the designation of the obese state is arbitrary - i.e., an operational definition - and indicates only that a particular magnitude of excess energy accumulation, frequently measured as body weight relative to height, has been attained in a disease process that, in most cases, has been ongoing for many years. Given the lack of evidence that obesity per se is linked mechanistically to the occurrence of cancer, an alternative explanation is that positive energy balance is a causal factor that permits the development of cancer.  \n",
      "The effects of different magnitudes of positive energy balance that result in different rates of energy accumulation in the body on the carcinogenic process have been investigated in animal models. However, those experiments, known as studies of caloric restriction, are generally not thought of in this light. Rather, given this nomenclature, the understandable perception is that studies of caloric restriction provide a model for starvation, famine, and/or profound undernutrition. Scientific literature contains examples of experiments in which it can legitimately be argued that this was the case; however, in a body of preclinical data on caloric restriction, experiments have  \n",
      "been carefully designed so that the magnitude of positive energy balance is altered by regulating the amount of energy ingested while providing animals the same amounts of all other dietary components [13]. Moreover, in some experiments, this approach has been refined by introducing the concept of meal feeding all animals in an experiment [14]. For the purposes of this discussion, studies in which the only variable was the intake of calories and in which animals were meal fed are referred to as studies of dietary energy restriction; those experiments will be the basis for the remainder of this discussion of mechanisms.  \n",
      "Because mechanistic studies of dietary energy restriction have been primarily conducted in animal models for breast cancer, this chapter is based on studies of experimentally induced breast cancer. Nonetheless, the mechanisms discussed are likely to be applicable to cancer at organ sites other than the breast because the underlying mechanism responsible for the energy balance-cancer linkage appears unlikely to be driven by effects on the metabolism of sex steroid hormones [15-17]. Rather, available data indicate that such effects are secondary and may serve to amplify the primary effects of different states of energy balance on chemical mediators that modulate cancer risk, depending on the responsiveness to these hormones of the target tissue of interest.  \n",
      "It has been reported [13,14] that female rats fed 60 to 90% of the number of calories consumed by their counterparts allowed to eat ad libitum for the same number of meals and same duration of time each day do not lose weight. Rather, they are in positive energy balance and grow at a constant, although slower rate, depending on the number of calories consumed per day. Animals in these different states are maintained on different levels of positive energy balance. For this discussion, animals that consume 40% fewer calories than animals fed ad libitum are referred to as having a low positive energy balance. They provide a model to identify and study mechanisms that may be operative in individuals that limit weight gain resulting in the accumulation of body fat by monitoring their caloric intake and balancing it with energy expenditure.  \n",
      "On the other hand, animals allowed to eat ad libitum experience a high positive energy balance and provide a model to identify and study mechanisms relevant to the effects of increased energy availability on the carcinogenic process. As summarized in Figure 22.1, candidate mechanisms being reported to account for the effects of different positive energy balance on carcinogenesis are presented in subsequent sections with the goal of identifying how positive energy balance affects the process of tissue size homeostasis, the failure of which is a prerequisite for the development of cancer.\n",

      "Carcinogenesis is characterized by a failure in the regulation of tissue size homeostasis in which a clone of transformed cells achieves growth advantage due to an increased rate of cell proliferation and/or a decreased rate of cell death in comparison to neighboring populations of cells [18,19]. The development of a carcinoma can be considered a failure of tissue size regulation attributed to the formation, selection, expansion, and progression of clones of transformed cells [18]. In addition, it appears that a co-requisite event in the progression of premalignant clones of cells to those diagnosed as malignant is the induction of vascularization [19]. Evidence is now presented that excessive caloric intake (high positive energy balance) creates a permissive environment in which normal controls to cellular proliferation are abrogated, the checks on cell number accumulation by apoptosis are diminished, and restraints on the vascular system to increase blood supply are relaxed.\n",

      "Rates of cell proliferation are generally low in populations of mammary epithelial cells at low risk for the development of cancer, but during premalignant and malignant stages of this disease process, cell proliferation is markedly increased [20]. In animals maintained on low positive energy balance,  \n",
      "FIGURE 22.1 An overview of candidate mechanisms that may be involved in accounting for the effects of obesity on the development of cancer: the cellular processes, systemic factors, and intracellular signaling pathways that may be involved are shown. PEB = positive energy balance; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1.  \n",
      "rates of cell proliferation remain low despite the fact that cells harbor the genetic defects requisite for the development of cancer. On the other hand, high positive energy balance is associated with increased rates of cell proliferation [20,21]. Emerging evidence indicates that low positive energy balance slows progression of cells through the cycle cell by retarding passage at the G1/S checkpoint [22]. Mammary carcinomas that emerge in low positive energy balance-treated rats are only 15% the size of age-matched carcinomas that occur in animals receiving high positive energy balance.  \n",
      "When these carcinomas were used to mirror the effects of low positive energy balance on the carcinogenic process, levels of phosphorylated Rb and E2F-1 were observed to be significantly reduced by low positive energy balance [23]. Reductions in CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activity in low positive energy balance carcinomas were likely to account for the observed effects on Rb and E2F-1. Both Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27, and levels of these proteins complexed with CDK2 were significantly elevated in low positive energy balance carcinomas, and levels of cyclin E were reduced. On the other hand, regulation of CDK4 kinase activity by low positive energy balance was likely due to a reduction in cyclin D1 protein as well as increased binding of P16 and P19 to CDK4. The majority of changes induced were reported to be reversed when animals were changed to high positive energy balance.  \n",
      "Thus, it appears that high positive energy balance is permissive to increases in levels of cyclin D and E, to lower levels of proteins in the Kip/Cip and p16 families of CKIs; these effects work in concert to promote higher levels of activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. Such changes result in the phosphorylation of the Rb protein and the release of E2F and related transcription factors - all of which support the sustained increase in cell proliferation considered a prerequisite for the development of cancer. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that high positive energy balance, which if unchecked will lead to overweight and obesity, increases cancer risk by perpetuating an environment permissive to the deregulation of the cell cycle that is characteristic of carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Apoptosis is a critical process in the regulation of tissue size and defects in this cell death pathway are a prerequisite for the clinical manifestation of cancer [19]. Available data indicate that low positive energy balance favors the maintenance of constraints on the expansion of cell populations through the upregulation of cellular machinery that facilitates the activation of caspases and the suppression of caspase inhibitors. Low positive energy balance has been reported to induce apoptosis in premalignant and malignant mammary gland pathologies [20], and the pathway by which cell death was induced has been investigated [24] using the experimental approach reported in Zhu et al. [25]. Using caspase activity assays, it was shown that the activities of caspases 9 and 3 were elevated approximately twofold in carcinomas from low positive energy balance rats compared to carcinomas from animals receiving high positive energy balance; caspase 8 activity was similar in carcinomas from both groups.  \n",
      "This finding implies that low positive energy balance induces the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis activation and is consistent with the finding that levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL protein were significantly lower and levels of Bax and Apaf-1 were elevated in carcinomas from low positive energy balance- vs. high positive energy balance-treated animals. Expression levels of transcripts for IAP1, IAP2, X-linked IAP, and survivin - proteins that can block the activity of activated caspases - were also found to be significantly lower in mammary carcinomas from low positive energy balance vs. high positive energy balance animals. Thus, high positive energy balance favors a growth environment that permits the expansion of nontransformed and transformed cell populations within a tissue. Given that high positive energy balance is permissive to suppression of apoptotic pathways and the relaxation of cell cycle restraints observed in transformed cell populations, it is not surprising that the magnitude of positive energy balance has been reported to be proportional to the magnitude of the carcinogenic response [14].\n",

      "Spatial limitations on the diffusion of nutrients and metabolic wastes between the vascular system and the cells that it supplies impose restraints on the growth of nontransformed and transformed cell populations [19]. Vascular supply to a tissue and its component cells can be induced via the expansion in size of existing blood vessels and/or the formation of new vessels. It has been reported [26] that premalignant mammary pathologies and mammary adenocarcinomas from low positive energy balance- vs. high positive energy balance-maintained animals were assessed for pathologyassociated differences in vascularity. The density of blood vessels associated with premalignant mammary pathologies, as well as the density of blood vessels in immediate proximity to mammary carcinomas, was lower in animals maintained on low positive energy balance vs. high positive energy balance, although positive energy balance had no effect on intratumoral vascular density.  \n",
      "However, it remains unclear whether these differences in vascular density were due to differences in concentrations of growth factors required for maintenance or growth of blood vessels or to the inability of endothelial cells to respond to growth factors when low positive energy balance is maintained. Efforts to identify effects of positive energy balance on the expression of an array of genes involved in vascularization were inconclusive, although the evidence suggested involvement of signaling pathways of which VEGF is a component [26]. Based on the effects of positive energy balance on vascular density, it can be inferred that low positive energy balance imposes limitations on the supply of nutrients to and elimination of wastes from developing pathologies; these limitations could exert direct effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in transformed epithelial cell populations undergoing clonal selection and expansion. High positive energy balance appears to relax restraints to vascularization, thereby maintaining an environment conducive to the expansion of cell populations. This effect is consistent with a positive association between energy balance and the risk for cancer.  \n",
      "The work presented in preceding sections is consistent with the view that high positive energy balance promotes the development of the cancer phenotype by fostering conditions favorable to the clonal expansion of transformed cell populations. It does this by inducing cells to leave the G, (quiescent) phase of the cell cycle. For cells that enter the cell cycle, high positive energy balance favors cell cycle progression due to its effects on the phosphorylation of Rb and the release of E2F1 from its binding to Rb. Increased phosphorylation of Rb is a consequence of the effects of high positive energy balance on the activity of CDK-4 and CDK-2 per the mechanisms described earlier.  \n",
      "In addition, high positive energy balance promotes the maintenance of the cellular antiapoptotic machinery by inducing changes in the metabolism of the Bcl-2 and IAP families of proteins. It is speculated that the effects of high positive energy balance on cell proliferation and apoptosis affect not only the expansion of transformed clones of cells, but also the ability of endothelial cells to respond to growth factors that induce vascular expansion. The coordinated regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and vascularization is responsible for the promotional activity of high positive energy balance.\n",

      "That the activity of three cellular processes is coordinately regulated suggests that a common molecular mechanism is at work; the hypothesis advanced is that these effects are a direct consequence of the effects of positive energy balance on glucose homeostasis (Figure 22.2). In response to low positive energy balance, glucose availability is reduced, circulating levels of insulin and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are reduced and of glucocorticoids are increased. One outcome of these changes is the limitation within a tissue of intracellular growth and survival factors. If this general hypothesis is valid, then it is important to determine whether the effects on carcinogenesis are due to changes in systemic factors involved in glucose homeostasis or to direct effects of glucose availability on cellular metabolism. Evidence addressing each possibility is reviewed in subsequent sections.\n",

      "Studies in rodents have shown that high positive energy balance accelerates DMBA- and MNUinduced mammary tumorigenesis in proportion to the magnitude of positive energy balance. In those studies, high positive energy balance was associated with higher plasma insulin levels again in proportion to the magnitude of positive energy balance maintained [27,28]. The relevance of these observations is based in part on reports that the development of DMBA-induced mammary tumors was inhibited by alloxan-induced diabetes and that alloxan- or streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats caused a regression of 60 to 90% of DMBA-induced mammary tumors [29-32]. Tumor growth was restored and tumor latency reduced upon administration of insulin to diabetic rats.  \n",
      "The effects of different positive energy balances that modulate mammary carcinoma development on IGF metabolism have also been investigated. In a number of model systems, low positive energy balance is associated with a decrease in circulating levels of IGF-1. For example, Ruggeri and coworkers [27] reported that positive energy balances that inhibited DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis were associated with reduced circulating levels of insulin and IGF-1, but not IGF-1I. A causal role of IGF-1 in mediating the protective effects of low positive energy balance was hypothesized; in that paradigm, the effects of positive energy balance were hypothesized to be mediated via a change in the availability of IGF-1, which in turn modulated tissue size homeostasis by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing the rate of apoptosis [33].  \n",
      "FIGURE 22.2 Magnitude of positive energy balance (low, L, to high, H) is positively associated with cancer incidence in the majority of organ sites investigated using animal models. Associations between positive energy balance and cellular processes and systemic factors that have been reported to influence the carcinogenic process are illustrated.  \n",
      "Zhu and coworkers have recently reported that protection against cancer is lost and plasma IGF-1 levels are restored to control values when animals are switched from low positive energy balance to high positive energy balance — also supporting a causal role of IGF-1 in accounting for the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic response. However, in recent work, those investigators found that infusion of recombinant human IGF-1 to low positive energy balancetreated animals failed to mimic the effects on the carcinogenic response of switching animals from low positive energy balance to high positive energy balance. Collectively, these data imply a permissive but not obligatory role of insulin and its related growth factors in accounting for the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic response.\n",

      "A role for the adrenal gland in accounting for the effects of low positive energy balance in preventing tumor development has been proposed [34]. As Zhu et al. reported [14], in comparison to high positive energy balance, low positive energy balance has been shown to increase urinary excretion of immunoreactive adrenal cortical steroids and levels of urinary corticosteroids were reported to be associated inversely with mammary carcinoma multiplicity. These observations were followed by a series of reports by the same laboratory [22,35,36]. Briefly, it was shown that, in vivo [22,35] and in vitro [36], provision of supplemental corticosterone has effects on cell proliferation but not apoptosis similar to those observed in response to low positive energy balance. In particular, corticosterone induced higher levels of the CKI p27 and lower levels of cyclin D1 - effects that would be expected to occur when cell cycle progression is arrested at the G1/S transition.  \n",
      "However, two recently published observations from this laboratory raise questions about the degree to which increased adrenal cortical steroid activity alone accounts for the protective effects of low positive energy balance against mammary carcinogenesis [37,38]:  \n",
      "- In an animal study in which dietary corticosterone was fed to rats at a concentration that increased plasma corticosterone to levels comparable to those observed in animals that were low positive energy balance, mammary carcinogenesis was inhibited; however, the degree of inhibition was markedly less than that observed in response to low positive energy balance.\n",

      "Over seven decades ago, classical biochemical studies showed that tumors have altered metabolic profiles and display high rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis [40]. Although these metabolic changes are not the fundamental defects that cause cancer, they may confer a common advantage that allows colonies of transformed cells to expand, survive, and progress to cancer. Consistent with those early biochemical studies, PET tumor imaging using the fluorinated analogue of 2-deoxyglucose on a large number of tumor types has provided substantial documentation of the increased uptake of glucose by malignant cells [41–43]. This implies that a relationship exists between glucose utilization and the development of cancer [44].  \n",
      "Evidence from recent molecular studies has revealed that several of the multiple genetic alterations that cause tumor development directly affect glycolysis, the cellular response to hypoxia, and the ability of tumor cells to recruit new blood vessels [44]. Oncogene activation and/or changes in tumor suppressor gene function result in alterations in glucose metabolism at an early stage during carcinogenesis. It is likely that these effects are due to the development of oxygen gradients that result in reduced oxygen availability in developing clones of cells and that these changes result in the stabilization of constitutively produced HIF-10. In turn, stabilization of HIF-10 leads to increased transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, glucose transport, and angiogenesis. Induction of enzymes involved in glycolysis results in a progressive dependence on glucose in those emerging clones because of the production of ATP via aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation; to support the increased requirement for glucose, expression of genes involved in glucose transport is also increased.  \n",
      "If transformed cells have an increased requirement for glucose but low positive energy balance reduces glucose availability, it is possible that low positive energy balance would decrease cellular energy charge (the ratio of AMP to ATP) in emerging populations of transformed cells with a consequent activation of AMPK. Available evidence, although limited, indicates that activation of AMPK not only conserves the use of glucose, but also regulates, at least in part, cell cycle transit, cell death, and vascularization via effects on the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins. Candidate targets of AMPK include p53, Akt/PKB, and Raf. As noted earlier, low positive energy balance retards cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition, induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial activation pathway, and has differential effects on blood vessel formation and growth.\n",

The investigation of weight control on the development of cancer requires an understanding of the effects of positive energy balance on the carcinogenic process: suitable preclinical models exist in which to conduct the needed research. Work summarized in this chapter indicates that positive energy balance affects the carcinogenic process by modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue vascularity. It remains to be determined why these cellular processes are modulated by positive energy balance, but the role of glucose homeostasis in mediating the effects of positive energy balance clearly merits investigation.\n",

      "Obesity is a common, yet complex and multifactorial disease whose development is modulated by contributions from genetic and environmental influences. This chapter discusses the genetic components of obesity - a complex area with more than 430 genes, polymorphisms, and chromosomal regions identified as linked to or associated with obesity in humans [1]. Given the breadth of the available knowledge, we focus on the genetic aspects of obesity that are most likely to be related to cancer and its prevention. First, the genetic contributions to obesity, based on data from twin and family studies, and how genetics and the environment may interact in the development of obesity are discussed. Then, current approaches and their challenges to detect genetic mutations involved in obesity are reviewed and select genes of interest, particularly with respect to cancer, are highlighted. Finally, the importance of genetic variability in the success of lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity and cancer risk is discussed. In the interest of space, review papers rather than original articles are cited whenever possible.\n",

      "Although obesity is controlled in part by environmental and behavioral exposures, strong evidence indicates that genetic factors account for a substantial portion of the variation in human adiposity. Several study designs, including twin, adoption, and family studies, have been used to determine the correlation of obesity measures between different family members and the heritability of obesity, which is the variation in a certain trait e.g., body mass index (BMI) that is attributable to genetic  \n",
      "factors. For example, a twin study compares how similar the obesity measure is between identical vs. fraternal twin pairs.  \n",
      "A detailed review of these study designs, including their advantages and disadvantages, can be found in Maes et al. [2]. These researchers determined pooled correlation estimates for various family member pairs across multiple studies of different designs that included more than 25,000 twin pairs and 50,000 biological and adoptive family members. The correlation for BMI (Figure 23.1) was smallest among genetically unrelated pairs (e.g., spouses), followed by partially genetically related pairs (e.g., siblings); it was highest among monozygotic (identical) twins [2]. This is consistent with a role of genetic factors in human obesity. Heritability of BMI also supports the role of genetics, although estimates differ by study design. The highest estimates are from twin studies (~70%), the lowest from adoption studies (~30%), and midrange estimates are from other family study designs (~40%) [2-4]. Several analyses combining multiple study designs with large sample sizes suggest that the heritability for BMI is between 40 and 65% [2,5].  \n",
      "Weight gain over time also appears to have a genetic component; among male twins, the heritability of adult weight gain over 40 years was 55 to 87% [6] and, among female twins, the heritability of change in BMI over 10 years was 57 to 86% [7]. Several studies have suggested that the heritability of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio is higher among women vs. men [8,9], but is similar for African-Americans and Caucasians [10]. Twin studies suggest that the heritability of BMI is higher in children and adolescents (~90%) vs. adults (~60 to 70%) and that, among adults, herita-  \n",

The number of studies contributing to each estimate is: 27 for identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, 32 for nontwin siblings, 37 for parent-offspring, 24 for spouses, and 11 for adopted relatives. Correlations are highest for the most genetically similar pairs (i.e., identical twins), intermediate for moderately genetically similar pairs (i.e., fraternal twins, nontwin siblings, parent-offspring), and lowest for genetically unrelated pairs (i.e., spouses and adopted relatives) (From Maes, H.H. et al., Behav Genet, 1997. 27(4): 325-351.)  \n",

      "Although genetics contributes to overweight and obesity, this factor alone cannot explain the sharp increase in the worldwide prevalence of obesity over the last several decades. The current environment, promoting high caloric intake and low physical activity, is thought to be largely responsible for the recent epidemic. In 1962, Dr. James Neel hypothesized that the human genome evolved under conditions of low food availability and high physical activity requirements [13]. Evolutionary forces favored individuals with genotypes that had an increased survival rate during food shortages, such as those with a genetic propensity for storing fat [14]. Thus, the prevailing genetic characteristics of humans are particularly ill suited for the current environment and cannot accommodate the rapidly changing shift from conditions of low to high energy intake.  \n",
      "As such, the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors is critical in understanding and reducing obesity. Several investigators [15–17] have suggested that the current population is characterized by individuals with differing genetic predispositions to obesity (Figure 23.2). As the environment changes from favoring low energy intake and high physical activity to high energy intake and low physical activity, individuals with a high genetic predisposition for obesity increase their BMI or fat mass more than those with a low predisposition. Individuals with genetic obesity, often characterized by a single genetic mutation (see the section on monogenic forms of obesity), have a high BMI in both environments. This model is supported by overfeeding studies. Among 12 pairs of identical male twins who participated in an overeating protocol for 100 days, the variability in weight and fat mass gain was three to six times greater between vs. within twin pairs [18]. Several genetic polymorphisms have also been associated with varying responses in overfeeding studies [19].  \n",
      "These data suggest that it is important to consider the environment and genetics in the study of obesity. Future research must focus on the genetic mutations underlying obesity (next section) and how these mutations may interact with interventions to reduce obesity (section on genetic variability and lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity and cancer risk).\n",

      "Recent findings have observed that mutations in rodent genes, which have human homologs, can cause similar phenotypes in humans, underscoring the highly conserved nature of the pathway regulating energy balance [15]. Spontaneous mutations causing obesity in mice have led to the cloning of the ob [20] and db [21] genes and the characterization of their human homolog gene products - leptin and the leptin receptor, respectively. Leptin is an endocrine hormone secreted by adipocytes that communicates information regarding long-term energy stores to the brain via its receptor. Mice carrying the ob or the db mutations are characterized by early onset obesity, hyperphagia, low core body temperature, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to diabetes mellitus  \n",

      "[20,21]. The ob mutation results in a lack of leptin production, and the db mutation alters the normal splicing of the leptin receptor gene, creating a premature stop codon; both ultimately lead to decreased leptin signaling [22].  \n",
      "Additional single-gene mutations resulting in obesity-related phenotypes have also been identified in mice, all of which have been linked to relevant mutations in humans or have led to the identification of a genetic pathway in which other genes were mutated. Identified human homolog gene products include growth hormone, insulin-signaling protein, cholecystokinin receptor A, lipin, carboxypeptidase E, attractin, agouti signaling protein, and mahogunin [1]. Knockout and transgenic mouse models suggest that many other additional genes potentially affect the development of obesity-related phenotypes. The study of animal models allows for the identification and understanding of the behavioral, metabolic, and physiological pathways involved in obesity.\n",

      "Monogenic forms of obesity are rare and are usually caused by a single mutation in a key regulatory gene, such as leptin. Pleiotropic obesity syndromes (e.g., obesity is one of multiple phenotypes) - such as the autosomal dominant syndromes of Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy; the autosomal recessive Alstrom, Cohen, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes; and the Xlinked Wilson-Turner syndrome - also are extremely rare and follow a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. The human obesity gene map [1] has identified over 41 Mendelian syndromes relevant to human obesity. Obesity is a clinical manifestation of such syndromes but is not a dominant feature.  \n",
      "Single-gene disorders resulting in obesity appear to be largely independent of environmental factors (see Figure 23.2). Obesity-causing genes that are mutated include: leptin [23], leptin receptor [24], pro-opiomelanocortin [25], melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) [26], and proconvertase [27]. The MC4R gene has at least 42 different mutations associated with obesity, making it the most prevalent genetic cause of obesity identified to date. Elucidating the role of these rare mutations provides valuable insight into the complex physiological process of obesity and the critical genes involved in these processes; however, it cannot address the genetic influences involved in the etiology of polygenic obesity.\n",

      "Common forms of obesity arise from the complex interactions of genes (which remain relatively unknown), environmental factors, and lifestyle behaviors and do not display the typical Mendelian pattern of inheritance. Studies of candidate genes indicate that most obesity-related genes have important functions in adipose tissue or in pathways regulating energy expenditure and food intake. Two study designs, the candidate gene approach and genome-wide approach, have been widely used to identify obesity-susceptibility genes, e.g., genes that increase the risk of developing obesity, but are not sufficient or necessary to cause obesity.  \n",
      "The candidate gene approach identifies obesity-related genes a priori on the basis of data from animal or in vitro models, suggesting their involvement in a biochemical pathway related to energy balance regulation or adipose tissue biology. Such genes are usually assessed using population (association) studies, which are a powerful tool for detecting genetic variation contributing to common obesity. These studies compare the allele or genotype frequencies between cases (e.g., obese individuals) and controls (e.g., lean individuals) or compare a particular phenotype (e.g., BMI) to identify polymorphic markers that differ significantly between the two groups. Associations observed in such studies could be due to the following:  \n",
      "- The variant allele directly causes the phenotypic effect .\n",
      "- o The allele is in linkage disequilibrium (i.e., the nonrandom association of alleles at linked loci) or the allele is closely associated with the true causal allele\n",
      "- o The observation is an artifact due to population stratification (differences in variant allele frequencies among diverse ethnic groups)\n",
      "- o Chance  \n",
      "Often, animal or in vitro studies are needed to determine whether the genetic variant is the likely cause of the obesity-related phenotype or is a marker for that phenotype. The candidate gene approach has successfully demonstrated that minor obesity genes contribute to the regulation of energy intake, energy expenditure, and nutrient partitioning [15]. For a comprehensive review of all the candidate gene studies conducted, see Snyder et al. [1] and Damcott et al. [28].  \n",
      "The genome-wide approach allows for the systematic survey of the entire genome to identify disease-related genes with no a priori assumptions about the potential importance of a particular gene or chromosomal region. Genome-wide scans are used to identify chromosomal regions showing linkage (or association) with obesity in large nuclear families and can potentially identify new or unsuspected candidate genes influencing human adiposity. In this approach, nonparametric linkage analysis is performed using a series of anonymous polymorphisms, spaced at constant  \n",
      "intervals over the entire genome, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and, eventually, genes within these quantitative trait loci. Any locus that influences the variability of a quantitative trait (e.g., waist-hip ratio, BMI) may be classified as a quantitative trait loci.  \n",
      "The nonparametric linkage methods, often referred to as allele-sharing methods, identify the chromosomal regions that affected family members share more commonly than would be expected by chance; the statistical measure of linkage or the likelihood of genetic linkage between loci is the lod score (logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage). The regions identified from the scans will become the focus of more intensive follow-up analysis to determine the disease-predisposing allele. Parametric analytic techniques, which require a priori knowledge regarding the mode of inheritance, can also be used. However this approach may not be appropriate for complex phenotypes such as obesity and could result in spurious associations. A review of these methods can be found in Haines et al. [29]. Results from genome-wide scans have consistently suggested that obesity genes are located on chromosomes 2p, 3q, 5p, 6p, 7q, 10p, 11q, 17p, and 20q [15], which appear to contain one or more genes involved in body weight regulation. A third, more recent approach involves tissue-specific gene expression profiles comparing lean and obese individuals [15].\n",

Over 270 studies have reported positive associations with 90 candidate genes; 15 are supported by at least 5 positive studies [1].

Several coding and functional mutations have been described in the ß -- ADR gene, yet have been inconsistently associated with obesity [1,32–35]. The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the ß .- ADR has not been associated with obesity in meta-analyses [36-38]; however, the polymorphism may be important only among women [39]. The Trp64Arg polymorphism may also affect the susceptibility to colon cancer in obese subjects [40].  \n",

The Pro12Ala functional polymorphism is associated with decreased receptor activity [42] and has been examined in 30 independent studies with a total sample size of 19,136 subjects. Meta-analyses suggest that Ala12 homozygotes have a significantly higher BMI than heterozygotes and Pro12 homozygotes, particularly among overweight individuals [43]. However, the Ala12 allele has also been associated with a modest decreased risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus [44].  \n",

It has an important thermogenic effect by promoting heat production and enhancing energy expenditure [30]. The -3826 A/G promoter polymorphism may influence body weight regulation.

Weak or null associations between other UCP-1 polymorphisms and obesity phenotypes have also been described [1,45,46,48-53].  \n",

      "HSL is a lipolysis-regulating protein that plays a critical role in energy homeostatis [54]. A noncoding dinucleotide (CA) repeat polymorphism may affect lipolysis regulation -subjects with five CA repeats are markedly resistant to lipolysis in subcutaneous fat cells [55], possibly leading to increased fat accumulation [56]. Additional polymorphisms in HSL also have been associated with obesity [57-59].  \n",
      "TNF-a is a cytokine that may modulate insulin sensitivity by inhibiting insulin signaling in fat cells [60] and stimulating lipolysis [61]. Increased levels of the cytokine have been linked to obesity and insulin resistance [62]. A -308 G/A promoter polymorphism increases gene transcription in adipocytes [63] and has been inconsistently associated with hip and waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, BMI, and body fat mass [52,64-68]. This promoter polymorphism is also associated with high rates of glucose oxidation in normal weight subjects and high rates of lipid synthesis in overweight subjects, suggesting an interaction between body weight and the functional promoter polymorphism [69].  \n",
      "Leptin and its receptor are involved in the long-term regulation of energy stores in the body, acting primarily in the hypothalamus [70]. Several polymorphisms in the coding region and the 5′ and 3' untranslated regions of the leptin gene have been shown to be associated with leptin secretion, body weight, and BMI [1]. Polymorphisms in the leptin receptor have been inconsistently associated with obesity [1,71]. Recent evidence suggests that the association between obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may be mediated by leptin and the leptin receptor through their role in the regulation of immune function [72].\n",

      "The principal methodological difficulties of addressing the gene-obesity associations in individual studies are:  \n",
      "- o The modest nature of the expected associations\n",
      "- . The large number of gene variants that will likely lead to a large number of false positive and false negative results\n",
      "- o Population stratification, which can lead to false positive results  \n",
      "It is essential to create very large datasets of prospectively collected information to maximize the power to detect modest associations because effects in individual studies may not reach statistical significance due to insufficient power. It is necessary to analyze the genetic variation in functional genomic regions comprehensively and perform haplotype analysis, which takes into account multiple polymorphic variants across the entire gene. The functional significance of the polymorphisms on the corresponding protein must also be investigated in animal models and in vitro studies. Falsepositive findings are likely to occur, so it is essential to replicate results in multiple studies.  \n",
      "To avoid publication bias and the expenditure of resources on inappropriate areas, it is important that negative findings are published and that positive findings are followed up in a systematic fashion to determine whether the genetic variant is truly involved in the etiology of obesity. Because obesity is a complex phenotype, studies need to define the type of obese subjects studied clearly — i.e., upper body vs. lower body obesity or early vs. late onset — and to examine a variety of phenotypes, including BMI, body fat mass, percentage of body fat, abdominal fat, fat-free mass, skinfolds, resting metabolic rate, plasma leptin levels, and other components of fat distribution and energy balance. Correctly characterizing obesity-related phenotypes will increase power to detect genetic differences and aid in comparability across studies. For a review of the challenges in genetic studies of obesity, refer to Comuzzie et al. [73].\n",

      "In the course of conducting genetic research of obesity, it will be important to identify synergistic relationships between different genetic mutations with respect to obesity [15]. Preliminary studies have suggested that additive and nonadditive genetic effects are important in obesity. In other words, allelic effects of some genetic polymorphisms may be amplified or diminished in the presence or absence of other genetic variants. Exploratory analyses have observed gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in ß -- ADR and UCP-1 with resting metabolic rate [74] and changes in body weight [75,76]. Similarly polymorphisms in ßx-ADR and PPARy-2 may interact with respect to BMI, insulin, and leptin levels [77]. These findings reinforce the idea that specific polymorphism associations with obesity may be underestimated if only their individual and independent effects are considered. Thus, it is important to understand the underlying physiological pathways involved in obesity to better address possible gene-gene interactions.\n",

      "Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are important in understanding the development of obesity. Of particular relevance to cancer is evidence suggesting that genetic predisposition may be important in the response of overweight and obese individuals to weight loss interventions. Much work has focused on behavioral and environmental barriers to intervention compliance; however less research has examined whether certain genetic mutations are linked with weight and fat loss resistance. An early study of seven identical male twin pairs who participated in twice daily exercise for 93 days reported that weight and fat loss were more similar within vs. between twin pairs [78]. Similarly, a family exercise intervention study reported that changes in waist circumference and abdominal fat measures were more similar within family groups than between families [79].  \n",
      "Several of the polymorphisms, including PPARY-2 and ß 2-ADR, discussed earlier also have been found to modify the effect of diet or exercise interventions on weight and fat loss. Prospective observational studies and intervention trials have been used to look at genetic modification of diet and exercise on BMI, weight, and fat. Multiple studies [80-86] suggest that the PPARy Pro12Ala polymorphism modifies the effect of dietary fat intake and/or exercise on obesity and weight and other intermediate biomarkers of obesity, such as insulin resistance (Table 23.1). This information lends biological credibility to the potential role of this polymorphism in obesity. Some [87-91] but not all [45,88,92] studies also suggest that polymorphisms in the ß -- ADR may slightly modify the effect of weight loss interventions (Table 23.1).  \n",
      "Two studies have reported that the combined effect of two or three polymorphisms may enhance resistance to weight loss. Phares et al. [91] reported that the combined genetic profile of 08-, D>-, and ß -- ADR polymorphisms and their respective interactions explained over 17% of variability in loss of fat mass and abdominal fat due to exercise among older adults. Another exercise intervention reported that polymorphisms in two different sex hormone metabolizing genes found in adipose tissue were associated with fat loss in older women; women with polymorphisms in both genes had a greater amount of fat loss than those with one or neither polymorphism, after accounting for adherence to the intervention [93] (Figure 23.3). These data suggest that it is important to understand how genetic predisposition may influence the success of weight loss interventions in the population. Focus on intermediate serum or plasma biomarkers is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying a possible interaction and how to better tailor interventions to individual patients.  \n",

      "FIGURE 23.3 Change in body fat measures due to a 1-year exercise intervention among postmenopausal women with no, one, or both polymorphisms in two different sex hormone metabolizing genes. Change in body fat measures during a yearlong exercise intervention in postmenopausal women by genetic profile of the CYP19 (TTTA) repeat and COMT Valine/Methionine polymorphisms. These genes are involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of estrogens, which are involved in adipose tissue regulation. Women with 11 (TTTA) repeats or with the Val/Val genotype lost more fat than women of other genotypes in univariate analyses. The two polymorphisms appear to act synergistically, so women ■ with neither the CYP19 (TTTA), repeat or the COMT Val/Val polymorphisms had the least amount of fat loss, after adjusting for age, caloric intake, and amount of exercise. Women ■ with the CYP19 (TTTA), repeat or the COMT Val/Val polymorphism had an intermediate amount of fat loss, and women □ with both polymorphisms had the most fat loss.

      "Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease believed to be the result of an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Family studies suggest that 40 to 65% of the variation in obesity is due to genetic factors. However, it is clear that the recent environmental shift promoting high energy intake and low physical activity contributes to the development of obesity in genetically predisposed individuals. To better understand the genetic components of obesity, research in animal models and individuals with monogenic obesity has provided a fundamental understanding of the physiological pathways involved in regulating adipose tissue and energy intake and expenditure. Focus on polygenic obesity, which is responsible for >95% of obese individuals, has identified few common polymorphisms that modestly affect obesity and likely account for a very small portion of the total variance of human adiposity.  \n",
      "Thus, it is important to identify more obesity-related polymorphisms and to better determine how gene-gene interactions are involved in the development of obesity. It is also critical to understand how genetic variability affects the ability of overweight and obese patients to lose weight and fat mass when participating in diet and exercise protocols. Intervention studies that have collected biological specimens from participants will be an invaluable resource in this effort. It is clear that the complex relationships among genes, environment, and behavioral variables on obesityrelated phenotypes complicate the identification of susceptibility genes and create an incredible challenge for scientists investigating the genetics of obesity. However, advances in bioinformatics, the completion of the Human Genome Project, the advent of laboratory high-throughput genotyping techniques, and the introduction of robust analytical tools will allow the search for the identification of genes involved in common human obesity to continue.\n",

      "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for all women (after lung cancer) and the leading overall cause of cancer death in women between the ages of 40 and 59; the incidence of breast cancer is increasing. Fortunately, due to advances in treatment, women with early stage breast cancer have a high remission rate and even those with more aggressive disease may be afforded many additional years of life. Virtually all breast cancer patients undergo surgery and most receive some form or combination of adjuvant therapy, including radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy.  \n",
      "Surgery and adjuvant treatments are associated with side effects that may have a significant impact on a survivor's quality of life (QOL) during treatment, although recent research indicates that QOL declines may persist into survivorship. A recent follow-up study on health-related QOL in breast cancer survivors reported that women treated with previous adjuvant therapy had a poorer QOL at an average of 6.3 years postdiagnosis compared to women who were not treated with adjuvant therapy [1]. In particular, past chemotherapy was a significant predictor of poorer current QOL. Thus, strategies that maintain or improve QOL from diagnosis into survivorship are important elements of the medical management and lifestyle of women with breast cancer.\n",

      "Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is described and assessed in many ways. Recommendations for QOL assessment in cancer clinical trials include physical, emotional, social, and self-perceptions of functioning [2-4]. In most settings, QOL is measured qualitatively through selfreport, most often using one of any number of standardized instruments. Several cancer-specific QOL surveys have been developed and are useful when assessing the impact of issues unique to the cancer experience (e.g., diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and treatment), but may in turn omit more generalized QOL issues to minimize survey length and participant burden. Most QOL instruments attempt to assess the impact of disease and treatment on distinct, yet overlapping, domains of function including: physical, role, emotional and social, as well as a sum or weighted sum of these domains to yield a general QOL index. Because QOL is multidimensional and qualitative, and instruments are somewhat variable, reaching a conclusive evaluation of any strategy aimed at improving OOL, including exercise, can be rather challenging.  \n",
      "Including objective and quantifiable measures that may underpin the self-report OOL domains could aid in the evaluation of intervention strategies and could also lend insight as to the mechanism by which the intervention has its effect. Numerous studies have reported on QOL and associated changes in women with breast cancer during as well as following treatment. For the purposes of this chapter, when evaluating the efficacy of exercise to maintain or improve QOL during and after breast cancer treatment, descriptions of outcomes on self-report QOL and outcomes likely associated with QOL (i.e., anxiety, depression, body weight, functional ability) will be included.\n",

      "A breast cancer diagnosis can have obvious consequences on psychosocial aspects of QOL. Psychosocial domains of OOL affected by breast cancer and treatment include anxiety, depression, hostility, cognition, reduced social functioning, and body image concerns [5-8]. Treatment further affects psychosocial and physical aspects of QOL, regardless of the treatment regimen [9]. However, the magnitude and domains of QOL affected vary by treatment type and the accompanying side effects [10].  \n",
      "Surgical side effects often resolve during recovery, though scar tissue and persistent lymphedema can impair upper extremity function on the treated side and psychosocial concerns from mastectomy can persist beyond recovery [9]. Radiation side effects include fatigue, skin changes, lung fibrosis, and nausea. Side effects of chemotherapy tend to be more numerous and debilitating and include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, weakness, cardiovascular declines, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, pain, diarrhea, insomnia, and ovarian failure in premenopausal patients that lead to consequences from abrupt estrogen depletion (e.g., early bone loss, hot flashes). Hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or anastrazole has notable side effects, including fatigue, hot flashes, night sweats, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness, vision changes, cognitive changes, and mood disorders depending on the medication. Side effects may contribute to the reduced physical domains of QOL reported by women treated for breast cancer, particularly those on adjuvant therapy [1,10,11].  \n",
      "The impact of breast cancer on certain domains of OOL may persist beyond the immediate post-treatment period and into survivorship. Prospective studies following women circa diagnosis through treatment and beyond indicate a persistent decline in domains of OOL up to 6.3 years postdiagnosis [9.12.13]. Specifically, using data from the Nurses' Health Study, Michael et al [13]. reported a higher risk of decline in functional health status among women with a breast cancer diagnosis compared to women never diagnosed with breast cancer, though the risks of decline decreased with time since diagnosis. Similarly, a long-term follow-up of women 3 to 6.3 years postdiagnosis reported a persistently lower self-report physical function compared to the general population and a higher risk of decline in physical function during survivorship in women who had a mastectomy and/or were treated with systemic adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy [8.9]. Psychosocial QOL domains were similar between survivors and cancer-free controls.  \n",
      "The impact of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment on OOL may be most pronounced among women who are less healthy at diagnosis or have less social support. In general, younger and older women who have poorer mental and physical health at baseline tend to have poorer psychosocial and functional health into recovery [5,14,15]. Furthermore, women who are more socially isolated at diagnosis tend to be at a threefold greater risk of decline in social functioning after treatment [13] and less social support at diagnosis is an independent predictor of lower long-term global QOL [1].\n",

      "Fatigue is a significant problem in cancer care worth further description because it is a common side effect of all postsurgical treatments. Most cancer patients report fatigue during and after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy; some cite it as a reason for prematurely ending treatment [4.16–18]. Studies of breast cancer patients who have completed cancer treatment suggest that persistent fatigue negatively affects quality of life [18-20]. A comparison of fatigue experienced by women with breast cancer at least 1 year following the completion of treatment noted that patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant experienced significantly greater fatigue than subjects who received only radiotherapy [19]. In a study of exercise in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, a strong inverse relationship was observed between fatigue and OOL [21].  \n",
      "This cycle of fatigue with the related loss of self-esteem and inability to perform activities of daily living or maintain social relationships and employment may have a profound effect on patients' quality of life [20]. The relationship among the negative outcomes of fatigue and quality of life in women with breast cancer is clear. Strategies that reduce fatigue in the short and long term may have profound effects on quality of life.\n",

      "Exercise, in most cases, is a neglected area of the treatment plan for cancer patients. Most health care providers fail to advise patients about exercise and the benefits that can be gained from it [22], though evidence on physical activity benefits is accumulating and becoming recognized by the oncology community [23]. Inactivity may be the trigger for the marked fatigue, weakness, and declines in functional ability and quality of life experienced by cancer patients and survivors. Exercise improves physical condition and mood state in healthy people and those with a variety of physical diseases such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and rheumatic diseases [24]. Exercise may serve a restorative function and contribute to decreased attentional fatigue by shifting attention from the mundane tasks of daily life to a period of exercise, which stimulates neuromuscular function and produces hemodynamic changes [22], or it may simply reduce depression and anxiety [25]. Exercise in a group setting may also reduce social isolation - a reported risk factor for QOL decline in women with breast cancer [1,13]. Thus, physical and psychological benefits from exercise have the potential to reduce fatigue and improve functional status and QOL in women with breast cancer.\n",

      "Due to greater feasibility, cross-sectional reports enjoy larger sample sizes. However, they are limited in the ability to establish cause and effect and most often rely on self-report activity, symptoms, and QOL. Despite these limitations, cross-sectional research can typically survey a broader demographic of the population and can generate hypotheses regarding the benefits of exercise.  \n",
      "Cross-sectional studies on breast cancer survivors using surveys and/or one-time physical assessments generally agree that exercise has a positive impact on the lives of breast cancer survivors during treatment. A retrospective survey of 71 early breast cancer survivors found that women who exercised throughout their treatment reported an increased quality of life [26]. A secondary analysis of data from a survey of physically active cancer patients to identify the most common symptoms experienced by women with breast cancer revealed that 45% of the sample returned to exercise within 24 hours after treatment, with no reported adverse effects [27]. The most frequently cited treatment-related symptoms improved with exercise were fatigue, general weakness, nausea, depression, and muscular weakness. A survey of 219 athletic cancer survivors' activity patterns demonstrated that patients with all types of cancer continue to exercise during treatment, albeit with reductions in the intensity and duration [22].  \n",
      "The majority of cross-sectional surveys of activity and QOL in breast cancer survivors are in those who completed treatment; most lend additional support for exercise benefits. Six of eight reports of post-treatment exercise participation detected significant differences in QOL and fatigue between survivors who exercised and those who did not. Sample sizes in these studies ranged from 54 to 119 and surveyed women undergoing various treatments. Exercisers reported better selfesteem [28], vigor [29,30], coping behavior [29], physical competence [28], body image [30,31], and general quality of life [26] and less confusion, distress, fatigue, depression, and mood disturbances [29-31] compared to nonexercising peers.  \n",
      "Only two of eight studies showed no differences between exercising and nonexercising survivors on measures of locus of control and psychosocial adjustment to cancer in 500 women who received various treatments and in 54 women treated with surgery only [32]. It should be noted that neither of these studies surveyed physical QOL domains or fatigue and thus they do not necessarily refute the positive effects cited in other reports.  \n",
      "Overall, cross-sectional surveys report a positive association among exercise, QOL and related psychosocial and physical factors, and fatigue. These studies cannot establish causality and include no objective measures of exercise or fitness. However, the consistency of findings generates sufficient reason to believe that exercise is feasible and beneficial for women with breast cancer during and following treatment and lends strong rationale for exercise intervention.\n",

      "Quasiexperimental one-group pre-post test and observational exercise studies provide stronger evidence for exercise benefits, but are less generalizable and methodologically rigorous than randomized controlled trials. A limited number of studies have been conducted in women during and after treatment completion. In a study of exercise in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, all women were prescribed an 8-week program of home-based, self-paced aerobic (mainly walking) exercise. In this study, subjects who adopted the exercise program experienced less fatigue and a higher quality of life (increased functional ability, reduced frequency and intensity of side effects, and improved positive and negative affect) [33-35].  \n",
      "Regression analyses showed that reductions in fatigue most likely mediated the positive effect of exercise on QOL [21]. Moreover, women who exercised longer experienced greater reductions in fatigue and the fatigue-reducing effect of exercise persisted for the next 24 hours, suggesting dose-response and carry-over effects of exercise on fatigue [36]. A 16-week structured, supervised, multimodal exercise program (aerobic + strength + flexibility exercise) also improved fitness (aerobic capacity, strength, flexibility) and OOL (increased positive affect, well-being and function, decreased distress) among 45 women treated for primary breast cancer [37].  \n",
      "Studies in breast cancer survivors post-treatment are mixed, but are also less methodologically rigorous because half observed exercise responses to intact community-based or self-reported exercise vs. an experimental program. Pinto et al. [38] followed exercise levels over 12 months in 69 women who had recently completed treatment for early stage breast cancer. Though average  \n",
      "exercise participation did not change over time and was below recommended levels for health, exercising was associated with improved physical function. Exercise was not associated with overall mood or cancer-related symptoms.  \n",
      "Twenty breast cancer survivors who volunteered to train for dragon-boat racing were followed over a 6-month period that included 2 months of aerobic and upper body strength training followed by 4 months of competition. Only lymphedema was monitored and was neither exacerbated nor improved by exercise [39]. A small study of ten breast cancer survivors participating in an 8-week multimodal, low-moderate-intensity program reported a trend toward fatigue reduction and improved quality of life and no effect on lymphedema [38]. Peters et al. [40] reported improved satisfaction with life among 24 early breast cancer survivors participating in a 7-month program that was initially supervised (first 5 weeks) then turned to self-directed, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry.  \n",
      "Quasiexperimental and observation studies of exercise in breast cancer lend modest support for exercise benefits on QOL improvement and fatigue reduction. Studies in women undergoing active treatment reported positive effects on QOL and fatigue. Post-treatment studies struggled to find a significant effect of exercise on QOL [38,40] and fatigue [39], but were generally of limited design. Randomized controlled trials will provide the strongest evidence for exercise benefits.\n",

      "True randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are more challenging to execute, but provide the strongest evidence for exercise benefits. Several exercise RCTs have been conducted in breast cancer survivors in active treatment or post-treatment.  \n",
      "Randomized controlled exercise trials have been conducted in women undergoing active treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. Only one study focused strictly on women with early stage breast cancer receiving radiation therapy [41]. Subjects randomized to the 6-week home-based, self-paced walking program experienced fewer and less intense symptoms, less fatigue, and improved functional ability measured by 12-minute walk. The same research group attempted a similar RCT in women undergoing active chemo- or radiation therapy, but had some problems with exercise compliance and contamination when 50% of the control group self-initiated walking exercise [42]. Participants were recategorized as walkers or nonwalkers and data reanalyzed. Women who walked reported less fatigue, less decline in physical function, and increased functional ability, quality of life, vigor, and mood.  \n",
      "Most RCTs in actively treated women were in those undergoing chemotherapy for early stage disease. Two of the first studies examined the effects of supervised moderate-intensity cycle ergometry exercise. MacVicar and colleagues [43] demonstrated a 40% increase in functional capacity among women with stage II breast cancer receiving chemotherapy without steroids. No such changes were observed in the control or placebo (stretching) groups. Exercising subjects increased their exercise time and intensity, demonstrating a training effect that may improve patients' QOL and ability for self-care. In a separate report, the same exercise program was found to attenuate weight gain and body fat increases compared to inactive controls [44].  \n",
      "These studies were among the first to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of an ambitious exercise intervention in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Later, Mock and colleagues [45] combined a home-based, self-paced walking program and support group intervention for women with breast cancer. Subjects in the intervention group reported increased exercise time, less fatigue, less nausea, less depression, and lower emotional distress than subjects in the control group. However, it is impossible to determine which intervention affected specific outcomes.  \n",
      "Perhaps the most ambitious study to date in actively treated women was conducted by Segal and colleagues [46], who studied the effects of 26 weeks of walking exercise on QQL and aerobic capacity in 124 women treated with radiation or chemotherapy for early stage disease. Women were randomly assigned to a usual care group or to one of two exercise groups that performed the  \n",
      "same low-moderate intensity walking program in a supervised or self-directed (i.e., at home, in community) setting. Women in the self-directed group reported improved physical function compared to declines reported by the usual care group. The supervised exercise group reported a slight increase in physical function that was not significantly different from controls.  \n",
      "The authors speculate that chemotherapy may have moderated the failure of the supervised group to improve because separate group comparisons among women not on chemotherapy showed trends for an exercise effect in supervised participants. Exercise did not affect other QOL domains or aerobic capacity in self-directed or supervised groups, suggesting that improved physical function may occur in the absence of measurable fitness improvements. This study was the largest RCT thus far; it suggests that home-based exercise has a beneficial effect on QOL in women undergoing treatment and that chemotherapy may moderate the effectiveness of group exercise.  \n",
      "A similar number of RCTs have been conducted in women who were, on average, 3 years posttreatment completion, usually on small samples. A cross-over design to test the effects of 10 weeks of supervised moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on psychological factors in breast cancer survivors (N = 24) found that exercise significantly reduced depression and anxiety but not self-esteem [25]. Similarly, breast cancer survivors (n = 24) randomly assigned to a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise program reported improved body image and less emotional distress compared to wait-list controls [31,47].  \n",
      "McKenzie et al. [47] conducted a small RCT in women with early stage disease and posttreatment lymphedema (n = 14). Women performed upper extremity light-intensity resistance and arm ergometry exercise for 8 weeks. No changes in arm volume or circumference occurred, indicating neither a positive or negative effect of exercise on lymphedema. Exercisers reported improved physical function, general health, and vitality compared to decreases reported by controls, but group differences were not statistically different. A small study that focused on physical performance and immune cell function reported that 8 weeks of supervised aerobic plus resistance exercise modestly improved aerobic performance and leg strength, but had no effect on immune factors. Improvements in physical performance are likely to improve physical functioning, though this was not specifically investigated.  \n",
      "To date, the largest exercise trial in long-term survivors was conducted in 53 postmenopausal women who completed treatment for early stage disease; some were on hormone therapy [48]. Women were randomly assigned to usual care or supervised moderate-intensity cycle ergometry exercise three times/weeks. Exercisers significantly improved their aerobic capacity, quality of life, happiness, self-esteem, and physical well-being, and lowered fatigue compared to usual care. Body weight and body composition were unaffected.  \n",
      "Results from RCTs provide promising evidence for the feasibility and beneficial effects of exercise in women currently treated or who have completed treatment for breast cancer. Importantly, these trials have established that exercise, even of moderate intensity, is tolerable during treatment and can attenuate treatment-related symptoms, particularly fatigue, physical changes, and QOL declines. Though sample sizes tended to be small, significant effects of exercise were detected. A handful of studies in women who completed treatment suggest that exercise is beneficial into survivorship. Because physical function may not fully recover following treatment [1,13], it is important to establish that long-term survivors can improve physical functioning and physical performance well after their treatment has ended - perhaps to prediagnosis levels, though this hypothesis has not been specifically studied.\n",

      "In general, exercise studies of varying design support the hypothesis that exercise can improve quality of life and associated physical and psychosocial factors and can lower fatigue. Crosssectional and quasiexperimental studies are mostly in support of this hypothesis, although a few, limited studies failed to establish a positive effect of exercise training. Randomized controlled trials  \n",
      "are relatively few in number and are difficult to compare due to differences in exercise protocols and samples. However, all showed some evidence for exercise benefits and, importantly, these studies determined that exercise is feasible for and acceptable by most women during and after treatment and that women in active treatment for breast cancer can adapt to exercise similarly to the general population.  \n",
      "The ability to improve functional ability and quality of life of women during and after treatment has tremendous personal and societal impact. Women are surviving breast cancer in record numbers, in part due to more aggressive treatment that can compromise QQL. As discussed, exercise is a low-cost, broadly effective approach that can maintain or improve QOL for women during treatment and for those likely to lead many productive years post-treatment. Furthermore, the utility of exercise may even prove to have economic implications in that patients who maintain function may be able to continue to work and may remain functionally independent longer than their counterparts who may be experiencing more limits in functional ability due to conditions associated with inactivity and disuse.  \n",
      "Limitations of the current research are important to mention. Relatively few RCTs were conducted and most were on relatively small samples. Despite the small sample sizes, significant benefits of exercise were detected, though the largest trial in actively treated women failed to detect a significant benefit of exercise in women participating in a supervised program compared to selfdirected (i.e. home based) exercise. In contrast, most studies of home-based or supervised programs suggest either setting can be effective. Most interventions were of limited duration, so long-term effectiveness of exercise training on QOL and fatigue in breast cancer survivors is unknown.  \n",
      "Currently, a specific exercise prescription for improving OOL and reducing fatigue in breast cancer survivors cannot be derived from this literature. Most studies followed the general recommendations for reducing mortality and morbidity from chronic disease for 30 minutes of moderateintensity activity most days of the week and used aerobic exercise as the sole or central mode of exercise [49]; they show that this public health prescription benefits women with breast cancer. However, it is not clear what minimal or optimal effective dose of exercise significantly improves QOL and reduces fatigue.\n",

      "Document 381:\n",
      "The current literature on exercise effects on QOL and fatigue in breast cancer survivors is promising and has generated exciting avenues for further study. Future studies need to be of longer duration, or participants who continue to exercise after trials are completed should be followed so that it can be determined whether women will adhere to exercise long term. Because exercise benefits are known to reverse when training is discontinued [50,51], the types of programs and approaches that promote long-term adherence must be explored. Likewise, because the most feasible setting to promote long-term adherence may be community or home-based programs [52], further and more rigorous study of these settings is warranted.  \n",
      "Additionally, the minimal or optimal effective exercise prescription cannot be determined from current studies. None compared varying doses of exercise intensity (low vs. moderate vs. high), time (short vs. long) or frequency (< 3 vs. > 3 days/week) or compared different modes of activity (i.e., aerobic vs. resistance). Only direct comparisons within a particular sample can determine the minimum amount of exercise necessary to produce significant benefits, whether more exercise produces greater benefits, and whether different modes of exercise are equally effective or have specific benefits.  \n",
      "It is also important to attempt to address the mechanisms through which exercise affects QOL and fatigue. One study suggests that physical fitness improvements may not underpin QOL and symptom improvement [46]. Because women more socially isolated and in poorer health at diagnosis are more likely to experience declines in OOL and physical health through treatment and beyond and are less likely to exercise, it would also behoove the research community to develop  \n",

      "This chapter summarizes evidence regarding the effects of exercise on quality of life (QOL) in survivors of cancers other than breast cancer. It begins by providing a brief overview of the incidence and survival rates for the most common nonbreast cancers and then briefly reviews the major medical treatments for these cancers and discusses their implications for QOL. Next, the concept of QOL and how it has been defined and measured in the cancer field is examined. After that, the published research on exercise and QOL in nonbreast cancer survivors is summarized. For this purpose, the literature review is divided into studies that included: (1) mixed site cancer survivors (i.e., survivors from more than one cancer site) and (2) single site cancer survivors (i.e., survivors from a single cancer site). Then, the two largest randomized controlled trials conducted in single site cancer survivors are reviewed. Finally, future research directions are discussed. Parenthetically, throughout this chapter, the term \"cancer survivor\" is used - as suggested by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship - to refer to any individual diagnosed with cancer, from the time of discovery and for the balance of life.\n",

      "Although breast cancer is by far the most common cancer diagnosed in American women, it still accounts for only about one third of cancers in this population [1]. The obvious converse of this fact is that nonbreast cancers account for about two thirds of all cancers diagnosed in American women (Table 25.1). After breast cancer, the most common cancers in American women are lung, colorectal, uterine corpus (endometrium), ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and skin melanoma [1]. These six cancers account for about 40% of all the cancers diagnosed in American women (a combined total more than breast) and about 60% of all the nonbreast cancers. For American men, the most common cancers are prostate, lung, colorectal, urinary bladder, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [1]. These six cancers account for over 70% of all the cancers diagnosed in American men (Table 25.1).  \n",
      "Many of the most common cancers in men and women have good survival rates. For example, prostate, colorectal, urinary bladder, skin melanoma, uterine corpus, and ovarian cancers all have 5-year relative survival rates of over 90% if they are detected early (Table 25.2). The high incidence rates and good survival rates for nonbreast cancers have resulted in over 7 million Americans who are survivors of these cancers.\n",

      "Although the prognosis for surviving many of the most common cancers is very good, medical treatments are usually needed. The most common treatments for cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic (i.e., drug) therapy such as chemotherapy, endocrine or hormone therapy, and biological or immunotherapy. These medical interventions reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival, but they can also negatively affect QOL. For example, depending on the location and extent of the operation, surgery can result in significant morbidities such as wound complications, infections, loss of function, decreased range of motion, diarrhea, dyspnea, pain, numbness, lymphedema, fatigue, and anxiety [2]. Similarly, depending on the dose and the site that is irradiated, radiation therapy can cause acute toxicities and late effects, including pain, blistering, reduced elasticity, decreased range of motion, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, diarrhea, lung fibrosis, and cardiomyopathy [3].  \n",

      "Chemotherapy may cause significant side effects including fatigue, anorexia, nausea, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathies, ataxia, alopecia, and cardiotoxicity [4]. The incidence and severity of these side effects depends on the types of drugs, mechanisms of action, drug dosage, administration schedule, presence of other comorbidities, and the use of supportive care interventions [4]. The side effects from chemotherapy can appear immediately, within a few weeks or months, or even years after treatment has been completed (i.e., late effects). Hormone therapy can have significant side effects, such as weight gain, muscle loss, proximal muscle weakness, fat accumulation in the trunk and face, osteoporosis, fatigue, hot flashes, and increased susceptibility to infection. Finally, although biological therapies tend to be better tolerated than chemotherapy, they can still produce flu-like symptoms that can be quite severe [5].  \n",
      "For many cancers, multimodal treatment (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy) is the standard of care. The timing and sequence of the multimodal treatments vary, depending on many factors including the type of cancer and its stage. It is possible, however, that some cancer survivors may be treated on multiple occasions with multiple modalities, concurrently or sequentially, for many months or years. Consequently, it is easy to see that such prolonged and intensive medical treatments may take a heavy toll on the QOL of cancer survivors.\n",

      "The concept of QOL is very important to cancer survivors. Gains made in survival from medical treatments must be judged against any potential decrements in OOL. In fact, QOL has become a standard endpoint in clinical trials of cancer survivors and in cancer care practice [6]. Perhaps not surprisingly, OOL is a difficult concept to define. Farquhar [7] has noted that most definitions can be categorized as global definitions or component definitions. Global definitions focus on overall happiness and satisfaction with life without making reference to any particular component of life. Component definitions, on the other hand, break down OOL into a series of component parts thought to be essential to OOL; most cancer researchers have adopted this latter definition [6]. Although no consensus has been reached on the number and nature of QOL components relevant for cancer survivors, the most commonly mentioned components include physical, functional,  \n",
      "emotional, cogmitive, spiritual, and social. Farquhar [7] has noted that such component definitions most likely contribute to the global evaluations of QOL.  \n",
      "Despite the difficulties in defining QOL, there is good agreement that it is personal and subjective [6]. Consequently, QOL is primarily measured by self-report. Some cancer researchers have used generic QOL measures such as the Short Form 36 Health Survey [8], but most have used one of the cancer-specific QOL measures, such as the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System [9], the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [10], the Functional Living Index - Cancer [11], and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale [12]. These scales assess multiple components of QOL such as physical, functional, and emotional well-being, using items relevant to cancer survivors.\n",

      "Previous reviews have noted that about 50% of studies on exercise in cancer survivors have focused exclusively on breast cancer survivors [13] and that even studies open to mixed site cancer survivors have recruited a disproportionate number of breast cancer survivors. Consequently, knowledge about exercise in cancer survivors is based largely on research in breast cancer survivors. However, breast cancer accounts for only 16% of the total cancers diagnosed in the U.S. The disproportionate focus of exercise researchers on breast cancer may have arisen for several reasons:  \n",
      "- o Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, which allows for an adequate sample size to conduct a single-center study on a single cancer site.\n",
      "- o The generally good prognosis of the disease makes OOL an important issue and exercise interventions feasible.\n",
      "- o The greater abundance of funding for breast cancer-specific research may have enticed exercise researchers into this area.  \n",
      "In anv case. in this chapter we review studies that have examined exercise and QOL in any group of cancer survivors other than breast.  \n",
      "A literature search was conducted in May, 2004, using the CD-ROM databases CancerLit, CINAHL, HERACLES, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SPORT Discus. Key words that related to cancer (i.e., cancer, oncology, tumor, neoplasm, carcinoma); the postdiagnosis time period (i.e., rehabilitation, therapy, adjuvant therapy, treatment, intervention, palliation); and exercise (i.e., exercise, physical activity, physical therapy, sport, weight training) were combined and searched. Relevant articles were then hand-searched for further pertinent references. To be included in the review, a study must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal and to have examined aerobic or resistance exercise. Studies had to include at least some nonbreast cancer survivors and a QOL endpoint. Studies that included a multiple intervention package (e.g., exercise combined with diet, social support, counseling, etc.) were excluded.  \n",
      "The search located 26 studies consisting of 1816 nonbreast cancer survivors from over 20 different cancer sites (Table 25.3). The studies were reviewed in two separate categories: (1) those that included survivors from mixed cancer sites (i.e., had more than one cancer site in a single study) and (2) those that were restricted to survivors of a single cancer site (e.g., prostate, colorectal). This review begins by providing an overall summary of the samples, methods, and results from the mixed cancer site studies. It then presents an ancillary analysis comparing breast to nonbreast cancer survivors from one of the previous trials involving mixed site cancer survivors [14]. Finally, an overall summary of the single site cancer studies is provided, followed by a detailed review of the two largest exercise trials in single site cancer survivors.\n",

      "- Only 2 of the 14 studies were randomized controlled trials.\n",
      "- Because the inclusion of mixed cancer sites makes it difficult to comment on any single o cancer site, the clinical utility of these studies may be limited.\n",
      "- Breast cancer was by far the most common cancer site in these studies (37%), which means that the information generated from these studies is still primarily applicable to breast cancer survivors.\n",
      "- The sample sizes were quite small and spread among many different cancer sites. Consequently, it was not feasible to conduct subanalyses based on cancer sites (i.e., examine cancer site as a moderator of exercise effects).  \n",
      "To explore this issue here, the authors report an ancillary subanalysis based on cancer site from one of their previously published trials - the Group Psychotherapy and Home-Based Physical Exercise (GROUP-HOPE) trial. This trial was a randomized controlled trial that examined whether a home-based exercise program could improve QOL in mixed site cancer survivors attending group psychotherapy classes. About 41% of the participants were breast cancer survivors. Significant effects in favor of the exercise group for functional well-being, fatigue, and sum of skinfolds have been previously reported [14]. The data were also analyzed by cancer site (breast vs. nonbreast) using an overall multivariate analysis of variance that contained all 13 outcomes. Such an analysis was significantly underpowered and, not surprisingly, no significant interaction was reported.  \n",
      "Here, analyses of variance are presented only for the three endpoints with significant effects (functional well-being, fatigue, and sum of skinfolds). These unplanned post hoc analyses revealed no cancer site by group interaction for functional well-being [F(1,92) = 0.3; p = 0.604], but borderline significant interactions for fatigue [F(1,92) = 3.7; p = 0.057] and sum of skinfolds [F(1,92) = 3.7; p = 0.058]. Independent t-tests on change scores within each cancer site category suggested that exercise had a larger effect on sum of skinfolds in breast compared to nonbreast cancer survivors (Table 25.5; Figure 25.1) and a larger effect on fatigue in nonbreast compared to breast cancer survivors (Table 25.5; Figure 25.2). These data should be interpreted with caution, however, given the post hoc nature of these analyses and relatively small sample sizes. Nevertheless, they are suggestive of a differential response to exercise between breast and nonbreast cancer survivors.\n",

Third, the sample sizes in the intervention studies were very small, with two exceptions [37,40]. Fourth, follow-up of participants was limited. Here, a more detailed review of the two largest exercise trials in single site cancer survivors other than breast is provided.  \n",
      "In the largest randomized controlled trial to date, Segal et al. [37] examined the effects of supervised resistance exercise training on muscular fitness and QOL in prostate cancer survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy (a common drug treatment for prostate cancer survivors that depletes testosterone to castrate levels). Participants (n = 155) were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 82) or control (n = 73) group. The exercise group performed nine resistance exercises three times per week at 60 to 70% of one repetition maximum for a 12-week period. The primary endpoints were fatigue and QOL (assessed by self-report scales) and the secondary endpoints were upper- and lower-body muscular strength (assessed by standard load tests for the chest press and leg press).  \n",
      "The researchers reported a 13% loss to follow-up (20/155) and a 79% adherence rate among all participants randomized to the exercise arm (including dropouts). Intention to treat analyses using \"last observation carried-forward\" for missing data showed statistically significant differences in change scores favoring the exercise group for fatigue, QOL, and upper- and lower-body muscular fitness. The fatigue change was 3.0 points and the QOL change was 5.3 points, both of which may be considered clinically meaningful changes for the particular self-report scales that were used. In terms of muscular strength, the exercise group increased upper-body strength by 41% and lowerbody strength by 32% compared to the control group's decline in these measures by 8 and 4%, respectively. Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that these favorable effects were present for men who were treated with palliative vs. curative intent and for men who had been treated with the therapy for shorter vs. longer than 1 year.  \n",
      "Courneya et al. (2003) examined the effects of a home-based exercise program on QOL in colorectal cancer survivors who had recently completed surgery [35]. About 55% of participants were receiving adjuvant therapy at the time of the exercise intervention. Participants (n = 102) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to an exercise (n = 69) or control (n = 33) group. The exercise group was asked to exercise on their own three to five times per week for 16 weeks at a moderate intensity (60 to 80% of estimated maximum heart rate) for at least 20 to 30 minutes each time. The primary endpoints were QOL (assessed by self-report scales) and cardiovascular fitness (assessed by a submaximal treadmill test).  \n",
      "The authors reported a 9% loss to follow-up (9/102) and a 76% adherence rate among those who completed the trial (excluding dropouts). The authors also reported that 52% of the control group reported regular exercise. Intention to treat analyses on those who had completed the trial showed no statistically significant differences between the two arms. In an \"as treated\" ancillary analyses, the authors reported that participants who increased their fitness over the course of the intervention had more favorable changes in anxiety, depression, overall QOL, and satisfaction with life compared to those whose fitness decreased over the course of the intervention. The QOL change score difference was 6.5 points, which may be considered clinically meaningful for the self-report scale that was used.\n",

      "Overall, the results of 26 studies to date suggest that exercise may improve QOL in survivors of nonbreast cancers. Several biopsychosocial mechanisms may explain the QOL improvements in cancer survivors that result from exercise training. Courneya (2001) has proposed a simple organizational model on how exercise might enhance QOL during cancer treatment (Figure 25.3) [41]. First, exercise may alter one of the many hypothesized biopsychosocial mechanisms thought to underlie improved coping and adjustment to cancer (e.g., fitness, self-efficacy, social interaction). In turn, changes in these biopsychosocial mechanisms may alleviate or prevent the occurrence of many of the common symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and its treatments (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, pain, anorexia). Amelioration of these effects may then reduce their impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living, leisure activities, interactions with others, and so on. Finally, enhanced physical and social activities may improve psychological distress/well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression) thereby improving overall QOL. No studies have examined the potential mechanisms of change for exercise and QOL in nonbreast cancer survivors.\n",

In general, randomized controlled trials are needed that focus explicitly on nonbreast cancer populations. It is clear from past research that exercise trials targeting multiple cancer survivor groups will likely attract a significant number of breast cancer survivors.

      "sufficient numbers of any nonbreast cancer group to be able to comment on the utility of exercise in these populations.  \n",
      "Moreover, even if such studies were to exclude breast cancer survivors explicitly, problems with mixing multiple cancer sites in a single study would still be present (i.e., \"apples and oranges\"). The main concern is that each cancer site is unique in terms of its demographic and behavioral profile, its disease pathophysiology, its prognosis and standard medical treatments, and its physical and psychosocial sequelae. Thus, different cancer survivor groups may respond differently to different exercise interventions.  \n",
      "The obvious solution to the \"apples and oranges\" problem is simply to conduct exercise trials in single site cancer groups. Such research may be a challenge, however, given the smaller number of persons diagnosed with nonbreast cancers. Nevertheless, a starting point would be to conduct studies in single site cancers that have sufficient numbers to warrant such a study - namely, prostate, lung, and colorectal. Prostate cancer actually has a higher incidence than breast cancer (see Table 25.1), so single center studies of this cancer group should be feasible. To date, however, only one study has examined exercise in prostate cancer survivors [37]. Similarly, colorectal cancer has a relatively high incidence rate and single center studies of this cancer should also be feasible in major centers. Once again, however, only one exercise trial has been conducted in this population [35]. Finally, although lung cancer is very common, the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of exercise in this population may be tenuous for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, clinical trials of exercise in selected lung cancer survivors may be warranted.  \n",
      "It may also be possible to conduct multicenter trials of single site cancers. This option may be useful for the most common cancers but may be particularly valuable for cancers with moderately high incidence rates, such as urinary bladder, skin melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and endometrial (see Table 25.1). This approach has the added strength of increasing the generalizability of the findings. One limitation of this approach, however, is the difficulty of standardizing exercise interventions across different centers. Nevertheless, as more research groups become involved in this type of research, the capacity for such multicenter trials will become greater.  \n",
      "Other options for facilitating exercise studies in single site cancers include:  \n",
      "- Keeping the eligibility criteria very broad (e.g., not restricting the sample based on age, comorbidities, disease stage, etc.)\n",
      "- o Focusing on prevalent cancer cases (e.g., all survivors > 5 years post-treatment) rather than incident cancer cases (i.e., only newly diagnosed survivors)\n",
      "- Testing home-based rather than center-based exercise interventions (which tends to exclude a large number of participants based on location alone)  \n",
      "Other creative strategies may be needed to conduct adequately powered exercise studies in all cancer survivor groups that may potentially benefit.  \n",
      "For studies that do not target nonbreast cancer survivor groups specifically, it may be possible to conduct subgroup analyses in the sample. Such analyses may help determine whether other cancer survivors respond to an exercise training intervention to the same extent as breast cancer survivors. The secondary analyses conducted in this chapter suggest that breast and nonbreast cancer survivors may respond differently to exercise, although the study was not designed or powered to answer such a question. If possible, it would be ideal to power the study a priori to conduct such a subgroup analysis by stratifying on cancer site prior to randomization and attempting to recruit equal numbers of breast and nonbreast cancer survivors.  \n",
      "In addition to starting research programs in nonbreast cancer survivor groups, research will be needed that examines the effects of exercise interventions on all aspects of QOL in these cancer survivors, including physical, functional, emotional, cognitive, spiritual, and social well-being. It will also be important to determine whether exercise can help control some of the common side effects of cancer treatments including nausea, pain, fatigue, weakness, and/or depression. Moreover,  \n",
      "for all of the preceding questions, it will be important to determine the optimal type (e.g., aerobic vs. resistance training), volume (i.e., frequency, intensity, and duration), progression, and context (e.g., center-based vs. home-based, individual vs. group formats) of exercise for all cancer survivor groups. Finally, studies are needed to elucidate further the mechanisms of change in QOL and to compare and integrate exercise with other currently accepted QOL interventions for cancer survivors. This information will allow for evidence-based guidelines for a given endpoint of interest in a given cancer survivor group.\n",

      "Although physical activity has been consistently shown to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and breast [1], little is known about whether physical activity also influences cancer recurrence or mortality. Much of the previous research among cancer survivors has successfully identified many clinical factors, such as treatment modalities and tumor characteristics, that enhance survival. However, given that modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity decrease the risk of cancer development, it is plausible that these factors could also have a favorable impact on cancer prognosis. Most research addressing physical activity among cancer survivors, however, has focused on exercise as a means to improve quality of life issues (i.e., sleep, fatigue, anxiety, depression, etc.) during and following cancer treatment [2].  \n",
      "Long-term survival rates for cancer patients have largely improved over the past 20 years due to advanced approaches in early detection techniques and adjuvant treatment [3]. More than 9 million cancer survivors currently live in the U.S. [4], and survivors are quite interested in identifying behaviors that they can undertake in an effort to alter the course of their disease. Recreational activity is a prime candidate to consider because of the opportunity for behavioral modification and the many noncancer health benefits of exercise. Identifying any beneficial prognostic effects of exercise on cancer survival might allow for recommendations to be made regarding its use as a clinical prognostic indicator and provide a basis for intervention strategies aimed at helping cancer patients make lifestyle changes to improve prognosis. Interventions among survivors are under way to promote increased physical activity [5] to test the effect of activity on general well-being or alleviate treatment-related symptoms [2,6], but little is known of whether it can actually help to reduce a person's chance of dying.  \n",
      "Factors such as physical activity that play a role in preventing cancer occurrence could also affect subsequent survival. The biological mechanisms suspected to mediate the relationship between physical activity and cancer development may continue to influence prognosis. Regular moderate activity has been hypothesized to affect cancer onset by altering endogenous sex hormones (particularly for hormone-related cancers such as breast or prostate), prostaglandins (mainly colon cancer, but perhaps breast or prostate as well), immune function, insulin or insulin-like growth factors (IGF), and body weight [7].  \n",
      "Few studies have investigated the various physiological responses of exercise among cancer survivors to gain further understanding of potential mechanisms related to recurrence, the presence of metastases, or mortality. The effect of exercise on hormone changes has been examined in one small pilot study of breast cancer survivors in which a slight, nonsignificant decrease in hormone levels associated with activity was reported [8]. One randomized controlled trial addressed exercise training on changes in insulin, insulin resistance, IGF, and IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) among post-treatment breast cancer survivors [9]. In this study, exercise had sigmificant physiological effects on IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and the IGF-IFGBP-3 molar ratio, but no difference was observed between the treatment and control groups for fasting insulin, glucose, insulin resistance, IGF-II, or IGFBP-1.  \n",
      "Several interventions conducted among breast cancer patients have shown physical activity programs to result in weight loss [10]. Among cancer survivors, the potential mechanism most studied in relation to exercise is immune function. A recent review of six small experimental studies of activity during or after treatment found that four studies reported statistically significant improvements in cancer-related immune system function [11]. Although literature regarding the physiological response to exercise among survivors is beginning to emerge, it is still unclear how and whether any of these changes relate to cancer survival because none of the studies described earlier included cancer recurrence or mortality as an outcome.\n",

      "A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify epidemiological studies that examined recreational or occupational physical activity in relation to cancer survivorship, excluding those focused on quality of life issues. A computerized search of English language publications up to June 2004 was conducted using the PubMed online database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) as well as manual searches of abstract lists for recent cancer or epidemiology conferences and the reference lists of all relevant articles. This search revealed pertinent articles for three distinct areas of research.  \n",
      "In this chapter, studies evaluating the relationship between physical activity and survival endpoints among cohorts of cancer survivors are reviewed. Next, studies addressing the association between physical activity and the risk of cancer mortality among apparently healthy noncancer cohorts are discussed. Finally, studies of physical activity prevalence in cancer survivors are examined to understand the effects of a cancer diagnosis on exercise patterns. No studies were found that explored whether cancer prognosis was associated with occupational physical activity.\n",

      "Australia, found no association [12]. The effect estimates were adjusted for different factors in each study, but each controlled for tumor stage or for size; this is important because mortality rates differ significantly by stage of disease [3].  \n",
      "There were some important differences among these studies that could explain in part the lack of consistency between these results. Accurately and comprehensively assessing physical activity levels is a challenge in epidemiological studies. As is often the case, the methods of measuring activity varied tremendously. The assessment tools used in each study included different types of activities and none took into account all three of the important components of activity (frequency, duration, and intensity), which is considered critical for a comprehensive assessment. The timing of the physical activity measurement should also be taken into consideration because important time periods of physical activity (for example, before or after diagnosis and treatment) may enhance survival, although no specific critical time period has yet been identified. Two studies [12,14] measured recreational activity in the year prior to diagnosis and reported conflicting results; the other [13] evaluated the effect of exercise at least 2 years following diagnosis and reported a decrease in mortality. Thus, it remains unclear whether the timing of the physical activity is critical in influencing survival.  \n",
      "Mortality rates varied among these three survivorship studies from as low as 10% [13] to a high of 27% [12]. This variation could be due to differences in the outcome (breast cancer mortality vs. all-cause mortality), distribution of disease stage, and the amount of follow-up time since diagnosis, which ranged from 5 to 16 years. The study populations also varied considerably with respect to age at diagnosis, geographic location, and year of diagnosis; these factors could affect results if mortality or physical activity level is related to any of them. For instance, the average 5year survival was 78% overall for women diagnosed during 1983 to 1985 compared with 87% for those diagnosed later in 1992 to 1999 [15].  \n",
      "It is inappropriate to draw any strong conclusions regarding the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer survival, given the limited number of studies. However, the two most recently reported studies [13,14] are very promising. This points to a great need for further research among breast cancer survivors, as well as survivors of other cancers, among whom no studies have been conducted.\n",

      "Table 26.2 lists the epidemiological cohort studies investigating the relationship between recreational physical activity and risk of all-cancer or cancer-specific mortality among adults who were free of cancer at study entry. In each of these cohorts, healthy adults were assessed for physical activity at the time of enrollment and followed for assorted lengths of time to assess cancer-related deaths. Studies with all-cause mortality as the end-point were excluded because, among noncancer survivors, a large portion of those deaths are assumed to be attributable to cardiovascular or other noncancer diseases.  \n",
      "Interpretation of the results found in the studies shown in Table 26.2 is difficult. In cohort studies in which the outcome under study is mortality and cancer incidence is not assessed, the results are clouded. Because it is known that physical activity reduces the incidence of several of the most common cancers (breast and colon, for example), any association noted with cancer mortality in these studies may simply reflect the association between activity and the development of cancer. Alternatively, these results could indicate that exercise reduces the incidence and mortality of all but the most severe cases of cancer.  \n",
      "Despite the ambiguity in interpreting them, the cohort studies shown in Table 26.2 may be informative, given the few available studies of exercise and prognosis among cohorts comprised entirely of cancer survivors. The results from these general population studies are mixed. With respect to all-cancer mortality, three investigations reported a statistically significant inverse rela-  \n",

The majority of these studies were able to control for potential confounding factors. However, it is possible that assessment of these factors may have been inadequate if these changed over the course of the follow-up period.  \n",
      "Few studies examined the relationship between physical activity and risk of death from specific cancers. One of the studies with a statistically significant relationship for all-cancer mortality observed similar results for lung or digestive cancer mortality, but no such relationship for \"other cancers\" [18]. In the Whitehall Study, which is a cohort of British middle-aged men, among those who were physically inactive, a worse prognosis was observed for all-cancer or hematopoietic cancer mortality, but no significant association was found for mortality from lung or colorectal cancer [16]. Another analysis from the Whitehall Study observed an inverse relationship between the number of minutes walking or bicycling to work each day and lung cancer mortality, but no association for all-cancer mortality or death from prostate, colon, hematopoietic, stomach, rectal, or pancreatic cancers [24]. One study looked exclusively at pancreatic cancer mortality and found no association with physical activity level [29].  \n",
      "Many possible explanations can be offered for the equivocal results. There was tremendous heterogeneity between these cohorts with regard to gender, age, study size, period of enrollment, geographic location, number of years of follow-up, and the year of study enrollment when physical activity was assessed. As with the studies in the preceding section, the physical activity assessment was seldom consistent and few measured all three major components of exercise: frequency, duration, and intensity. A big concern with long-term cohorts is the potential for misclassification of the physical activity exposure if the activity level measured at baseline is not reflective of average levels prior to the time of study entry or changes in activity during the follow-up period.  \n",
      "Most of these studies measured physical activity only once at baseline and none attempted to assess lifetime activity. One study combined 5 years of physical activity assessments over a 12year period to obtain a cumulative average activity level [21]. Another study assessed activity at baseline and again 4.7 to 7 years later to assess the effect of changes in activity level. In this study, no association was present for the baseline measure alone, but those who were sedentary at baseline and then considered active at the second interval had a significantly lower risk of cancer death compared to those who were sedentary at both points in time [19].  \n",
      "Although the relationship between physical activity and risk of cancer death remains inconclusive, a small majority of the studies listed in Table 26.2 point in the direction of a preventive role of physical activity on cancer mortality. More research with better assessment methods for physical activity among cohorts of cancer survivors is clearly needed.\n",

      "Studies examining the prevalence of recreational physical activity among cancer survivors are described in Table 26.3. These employ several different types of study designs. Several studies simply reported the prevalence of activity. A study of prostate and breast cancer survivors found the majority (62 and 56%, respectively) reported being active (*activity that gets your heart thumping or causes you to sweat for periods > 30 minutes\") on a routine weekly basis [30]. However, another small study [31] of breast cancer patients found most women to exercise below American College of Sports Medicine [32] guidelines (vigorous exercise at least ≥ three times/week for ≥20 minutes per day or moderate exercise ≥ five times per week for ≥30 minutes per day). A report on survivors of childhood cancers found that those who were still under age 18 remained relatively active, but that survivors over 18 were active much less frequently [33].  \n",

A study of adult cancer survivors found 15.7% exercised more, 53.6% exercised the same amount, and 30.6% exercised less after diagnosis compared with the earlier prediagnostic period [36]. The survivors were more likely to increase their exercise levels following diagnosis if not currently undergoing treatment and if interviewed more than a year since their diagnosis. In a similar study of breast cancer survivors interviewed 4 to 12 months following diagnosis, activity levels decreased by 2 hours/week from pre- to postdiagnosis [37]. Decreases were greatest for women treated with radiation and chemotherapy compared to surgery or radiation alone as well as for those who were obese compared to normal weight women.  \n",
      "Two studies of breast cancer survivors and one with colorectal cancer survivors examined physical activity participation before diagnosis, during cancer treatment, and post-treatment [38-40]. These studies generally found one quarter to one third of survivors remained consistently active or inactive at all three periods. Another large group was found to be inactive only during the treatment period; a significant proportion of those who were active prior to diagnosis never resumed an active lifestyle following treatment.  \n",
      "These studies provide some insight into the impact of a cancer diagnosis on physical activity behaviors. In particular, cancer patients undergo special challenges associated with treatment, such as fatigue and weight change, that may affect ability or interest in maintaining or initiating exercise. Although activity appears to diminish in the treatment phase, the studies of longer term survivors suggest that perhaps activity levels eventually resume to prediagnosis levels for most people or, at least, levels comparable to the general population. However, it is unclear how quickly activity increases during the post-treatment period.  \n",
      "From a methodological standpoint, it may not be sufficient to assess only prediagnosis activity in studies of physical activity and survival if prediagnosis levels are not reflective of postdiagnosis levels. To clarify whether pre- and/or postdiagnosis exercise influences survival, future studies will need to include comprehensive assessment of activity through the life course as well as the postdiagnostic period.\n",

      "This review exposes the scarcity of research on whether survival is enhanced among those who are physically active, occupationally or recreationally, before or after cancer diagnosis. There is a strong need for further identification of new prognostic factors to improve the prediction of women at increased risk for recurrence or mortality. Physical activity is particularly noteworthy because it is a modifiable factor that could provide an opportunity for patients to enhance their survival. In addition to studying the impact of exercise on survival outcomes (mortality, recurrence, secondary cancers, and metastasis) among cohorts of survivors, intervention studies of the physiological effects of activity among cancer patients are warranted in order to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms.  \n",
      "Most studies reviewed here were conducted among breast cancer survivors. Future studies should include patients of different cancer sites and stages because of considerable variation in pathogenesis, mortality rates, and treatment-related problems. More thorough and comprehensive physical activity assessments that incorporate measures of intensity, duration, frequency, and timing of the activity would aid in determining the true relationship between physical activity and prognosis.\n",

      "Energy balance, as reflected by body size, has received considerable attention as a potential prognostic factor in breast cancer. In 1976, Abe [1] first reported an association of obesity with poor outcome in early stage breast cancer. As of early 2004, over 50 studies [1-51] examining this association had been published (a smaller body of research has investigated body size in metastatic breast cancer). The majority of the studies in locoregional breast cancer have identified an adverse prognostic effect of obesity, leading to a growing consensus that obesity is a significant and independent adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer. One recent review [52] concluded that \"the current evidence relating increased body weight to breast cancer outcome and the documented favorable effects of weight loss on clinical outcome in other comorbid conditions support consideration of programs for weight loss in breast cancer patients.\" Thus, there is interest in the development of weight loss programs targeting women with breast cancer and, more importantly, in studying the effect of such programs on the outcomes of these women.  \n",
      "In parallel to this research examining prognostic effects of weight in breast cancer, additional work has investigated the phenomenon of weight gain after diagnosis of locoregional breast cancer [53-90]. This research has demonstrated that weight gain in this situation is common and is associated with a variety of factors (reviewed later). Some evidence indicates that large amounts of weight gain postdiagnosis may contribute to poor breast cancer outcomes. These observations have enhanced interest in the development of weight management programs for women with breast cancer.  \n",
      "More recently, research has increasingly focused on understanding the underlying physiological basis for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity in breast cancer [49,52,91]. Several potential mechanisms for this effect have been hypothesized; the majority focus on alterations in hormone levels (notably estrogen) in obese individuals. Recent research has suggested that insulin, a member of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors, may also play an important role. Alternate explanations include suggestions that obesity is associated with presentation of breast cancer at more advanced stages or that it may lead to undertreatment, particularly in those receiving chemotherapy. These potential mechanisms will be discussed.  \n",
      "Despite the growing consensus that obesity is associated with breast cancer outcome, a detailed review of the evidence supporting this potential association is necessary. The 51 published studies of obesity and locoregional breast cancer prognosis [1-51] will be reviewed in the next section, followed by a discussion of weight gain postdiagnosis. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity will be discussed in subsequent sections.\n",

      "Published studies examining the association of a measure of body size (weight, or an index of obesity such as body mass index (wt/h2, BMI) or percent ideal weight) are outlined in Table 27.1. Studies published as full reports are included; studies published in abstract form only are not included. Furthermore, only studies that focused on women with locoregional breast cancer or reported on results in locoregional breast cancer separately are included. A small number of studies in which less than 10% of the study population had advanced disease is also included, as long as the stage was considered in the analysis [14.15,20.23.31]. Studies conducted solely in advanced breast cancer are excluded because mechanisms for prognostic effects of obesity might differ significantly in the metastatic setting - for example, metastatic disease may lead to weight loss. These studies will be summarized briefly at the end of this section. Table 27.1 lists studies in chronological order, and information is provided on study design, including:  \n",

      "It can be seen that studies included in Table 27.1 span more than a quarter of a century, from 1976 to 2004. The majority were retrospective cohort studies, with patients identified through hospital records, government registries, screening programs, or, occasionally, randomized clinical trials. Most studies used measures of body size that were obtained for nonresearch proposes (usually taken from clinical records or registry databases). Approaches such as this could lead to increased measurement error, especially if factors such as the amount of clothing worn were not controlled (potentially increasing type II error) or to systematic underestimation of body size in studies in which weight was self-reported (potentially introducing bias). The size of the studies varied considerably: from 25 [7] to over 8000 [20] participants; the average size was 942 subjects.  \n",
      "Body size was measured for study purposes in only 12 studies [14.20.26.29.33.35. 37,38,42,44.46,491: in the majority of these studies, it was measured many years prior to breast cancer diagnosis as part of screening or etiological studies. In the remaining studies, body size was usually obtained from medical records; occasionally, it was obtained by self-report. In several studies, subjects were recruited years prior to diagnosis for research into risk factors or screening programs [20.26.29.33.35–37.42.43.48]. By design, these studies capture the effect of body size (and other factors) on breast cancer risk and prognosis. All entries in Table 27.1 (apart from time period of recruitment) relate to the impact of body size on breast cancer prognosis. However, because body size was measured years prior to diagnosis in these studies, the relationship between  \n",

      "obesity and prognosis may differ from the relationship when body size was measured at breast cancer diagnosis.  \n",
      "The majority of studies calculated a measure of obesity, usually BMI (weight/height2, also known as Quetelet index), to analyze prognostic effects. Because such measures take the relationship of weight to height into consideration, they may provide information that is more biologically meaningful than weight alone.  \n",
      "Only 21 studies reported on the use of systemic adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or ovarian ablation) in their study population [5,8,9,16,17,21,23,24,27,30, 31,34,37-39,41,46-50]; many of these included the effects of such treatment in adjusted prognostic analyses. However, the majority of studies did not address the issue of systemic adjuvant therapy, descriptively or in their analyses. Often this was because subjects were diagnosed prior to the widespread use of systemic adjuvant therapy; however, many studies of women diagnosed after 1980 did not consider this potentially important factor. Furthermore, although most studies attempted to consider effects of other prognostic factors (e.g., age, stage, grade) by analyzing effects of obesity in subsets of women or by conducting multivariate prognostic analyses, few studies considered effects of all potentially important confounders.  \n",
      "As can be seen from Table 27.1, the majority of studies identified an adverse prognostic effect of obesity in women with locoregional breast cancer. In total, 36 studies, representing 35,103 women (73.1% of those studied), identified a significant adverse effect of weight or obesity overall or in a subset of women. In contrast, 15 studies involving 12,949 women (26.9% of all women studied) failed to identify a significant adverse effect of body size. The magnitude of the prognostic effect was not always reported and, when it was, comparison groups were not consistent. Some authors reported hazard ratios (HRs) for subjects above and below an average weight (or BMI) [5]; others reported HRs for subjects above a specific BMI cutpoint compared to those with a \"normal\" BMI (20 to 25 kg/m²) [29] or per unit BMI [44]. In general, when effect sizes were reported, they were moderate, obese women having an increased risk of recurrence or death in the range of 1.5 to 2.5.  \n",
      "In some studies, when extremes were examined, they were associated with larger risk (fourfold or greater) [32]. These observations are in keeping with an earlier meta-analysis [92] in which over 30 studies were included. The HRs for distant recurrence and death in overweight women were 1.91 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.40) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.76), respectively. Vatten et al. [26] calculated the attributable risk of death in breast cancer due to BMI > 27 kg/m² to be approximately 50% in their study, suggesting that the contribution of obesity to breast cancer outcome may be of considerable clinical relevance.  \n",
      "Some evidence indicates that the association of obesity with breast cancer outcome may not be linear. Curvilinear (quadratic) associations were reported in two studies [18,49] but not confirmed in another study [30]. Body size was treated as an ordinal variable in many studies (often as a dichotomous variable in earlier studies); in these studies, the linear (or nonlinear) nature of the association could not be examined. Nonetheless, it appears that prognostic effects of BMI are probably greatest in the most overweight women and that underweight women may also have poor outcomes.  \n",
      "No characteristics of study design consistently distinguished studies identifying significant adverse effects of obesity from those that did not. Early as well as recent studies have identified, or failed to identify, significant adverse effects. Mean sample size in \"positive\" studies was 981 women and, in \"negative\" studies, it was 831 - a difference unlikely to account for the observed variability in results. The smallest study [7], involving 25 women, identified a significant adverse prognostic effect of overweight and obesity at 10 years. The measure of body size investigated also did not predict results; significant adverse effects were identified when body size was measured as weight, percent ideal weight, or an obesity index and when body size was treated continuously or ordinally in analyses. As noted previously, some studies measured body size years prior to diagnosis;  \n",
      "many of these studies identified significant adverse prognostic effects of obesity, although effects of body size on breast cancer risk may confound these results.  \n",
      "The results reported by Dignam et al. [50] suggest that obesity may increase risk of new primary cancers and non-breast cancer related mortality but not breast cancer recurrence or death. That is, it may not actually have an effect on breast cancer progression. However, results of the full range of studies suggest that this is not the case. Of the studies listed in Table 27.1, 27 reported associations of obesity with overall survival (or all cause mortality); 17 of these (63.0%) identified significantly increased risk in obese women. Breast cancer-specific mortality was examined in 25 studies; 17 of these (68.0%) identified significant adverse effects of obesity. The effect of obesity on breast cancer recurrence was evaluated in 20 studies; 13 (65.0%) identified adverse effects. Finally, 40 studies considered effects of obesity on at least one breast cancer-specific outcome (recurrence or breast cancer-specific survival). Of these, 28 (70%) identified significant adverse effects.  \n",
      "Thus, there is little evidence that adverse prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer are due to effects on non-breast-cancer deaths; on the contrary, a slightly greater proportion of studies that evaluated breast cancer-specific outcomes identified adverse prognostic effects when compared to studies evaluating all-cause mortality. Dignam et al. [50] studied women with low-risk breast cancer (hormone receptor positive, node negative), many of whom received tamoxifen. Failure to identify effects of obesity on breast cancer outcomes may reflect low breast cancer event rates, and a greater relative contribution of competing (i.e., not breast cancer) causes of deaths in this good prognosis population.  \n",
      "One possible explanation for the inconsistent prognostic effects of obesity reported is that obesity exerts a prognostic effect present only in a subgroup of women. Differential effects according to menopausal status or hormone receptor (estrogen, progesterone) status have been most commonly postulated. Studies investigating these subsets are summarized in Table 27.2 and Table 27.3.  \n",
      "Given that the association of obesity with breast cancer risk varies according to menopausal status, it is plausible that prognostic effects of obesity might differ with respect to menopausal status. Obesity is associated with an increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women and a decreased risk in premenopausal woman (see Chapter 14 (93)). In Table 27.2, results of studies that reported prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal and postmenopausal women separately are summarized. Prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal women were evaluated in 13 studies. Eight of these (61.5%) identified significant adverse effects, despite the fact that sample sizes were considerably smaller than in the full studies listed in Table 27.1. Six (42.9%) of the 14 studies that evaluated prognostic effects in postmenopausal women identified significant adverse effects of obesity. Once again, these analyses were usually conducted in subsets of the overall study population, leading to reduced power.  \n",
      "These results suggest that an adverse prognostic effect of obesity is present in pre- and postmenopausal women and, in contrast to the impact of obesity on breast cancer risk, its impact on prognosis may be greatest in premenopausal women. As will be discussed later, this observation has implications for understanding potential pathophysiological mechanisms for prognostic effects of obesity.  \n",
      "Prognostic effects of obesity in hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative breast cancer have been reported in a smaller number of studies (Table 27.3). Two early studies [14,37] provide evidence that the prognostic effect of obesity may be greatest in estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive individuals. As noted earlier, a recent study by Dignam et al. [50] analyzed prognostic effects of obesity in the NSABP-B14 study conducted in estrogen receptor-positive, node negative-breast cancer. This study failed to identify an effect of obesity on breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer death, despite the finding of an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer and increased all-cause mortality in obese individuals. The majority of women in that study received tamoxifen, and it is possible that administration of tamoxifen to women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer may abrogate the adverse prognostic effects of obesity.  \n",

      "A second study [37] reported a reduced risk of death in obese vs. nonobese women who were estrogen receptor negative. Unfortunately, the small number of studies that have investigated prognostic effects of obesity according to estrogen receptor status, coupled with the small numbers of subjects with receptor-negative tumors, make it difficult to draw conclusions about the potential for differential effects of obesity in receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer. Additional research in this area, which also examines interactions with hormonal adjuvant therapies (estrogen receptor blockers, aromatase inhibitors), is needed to resolve this issue.  \n",
      "The question of whether prognostic effects of obesity differ according to the presence or absence of other tumor characteristics was addressed in the 13 studies summarized in Table 27.4. With some exceptions, these studies identified effects that were greatest in tumors with favorable prognostic factors - usually defined as small tumor size, less advanced tumor stage, or uninvolved axillary lymph nodes. Taken together with results in hormone receptor-positive cancers summarized in Table 27.3, these results suggest that adverse prognostic effects of obesity may be greatest in lower risk breast cancers, but they are not absent in higher risk cancers  \n",
      "This observation contrasts to some extent with growing evidence, summarized in Table 27.5, that obese women are more likely to have breast cancers that have unfavorable prognostic characteristics. In the majority of studies that examined this relationship, obesity was associated with advanced stage, larger tumor size, and/or greater axillary nodal involvement. Inconsistent associations of obesity with estrogen receptor status have been reported. Because of these observations, it has been suggested that adverse prognostic effects of obesity may not be independent of traditional prognostic factors - that is, obese women may present with more advanced stage breast cancer, possibly due to delayed diagnosis.\n",

      "However, this appears to be unlikely as the sole explanation for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity, given that the adverse prognostic effect of obesity identified in studies listed in Table 27.1 persisted after adjustment for many prognostic factors, notably tumor stage and nodal status, and, at times, hormone receptor status and tumor grade in the majority of studies that conducted such analyses. In at least one study [27], an adverse effect of obesity was seen only after adjustment for such factors.  \n",
      "As noted earlier, only a minority of the studies listed in Table 27.1 reported use of adjuvant systemic therapy - chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Furthermore, in most of the studies that did report use of systemic adjuvant therapy, not all women received such therapy and prognostic effects of obesity were rarely reported after adjustment for adjuvant therapy or only in those receiving adjuvant therapy. Nonetheless, two recent studies conducted in the context of randomized clinical trials of systemic therapy failed to identify adverse prognostic effects of obesity on breast cancer recurrence or death in those receiving chemotherapy [38] or tamoxifen [50]. As noted previously, adverse effects of obesity on contralateral breast cancer and on all-cause mortality were noted in the latter study.  \n",

      "Daling et al. [48] reported that adverse effects of obesity present in the overall study population and in those receiving non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy were not present in those who received doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. These observations raise the question of whether modern adjuvant systemic adjuvant therapies abrogate prognostic effects of obesity in locoregional breast cancer. This is an area that should be an urgent focus for future research because this would influence the design of future intervention studies.  \n",
      "The preceding discussion has focused on locoregional breast cancer. A small number of studies has investigated prognostic effects of obesity in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer [8,10,94,95]. An adverse effect of obesity was seen in only one of these studies [8]. However, the available data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions about effects of obesity on outcomes in metastatic breast cancer.  \n",
      "In summary, the prognostic effects of obesity in locoregional breast cancer have been extensively studied. The preponderance of evidence supports an adverse effect on breast cancer outcomes (although the effect may not be linear). The effect is moderate in size and may be most pronounced, but not exclusive to, tumors with characteristics that are usually associated with favorable outcomes. Obesity influences prognosis in pre- and postmenopausal women. However, despite this extensive body of research, important questions remain. These include whether effects of obesity differ according to hormone receptor status and, more importantly, whether obesity influences prognosis in women receiving current adjuvant therapies, including anthracyclines, taxanes, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors.\n",

      "Weight gain after diagnosis of locoregional breast cancer was first reported by Dixon et al. in 1978 [54]. Since that time, over 35 studies [55–90] have examined this phenomenon. All but two [78,80] of these studies have found evidence of weight gain during the first year or two after breast cancer diagnosis. This weight gain has been shown to be associated with anxiety over appearance [55] and with reduced quality of life [96]. The weight gain reported has been of variable magnitude with averages ranging from more than 10 kg over 1 year [55,56] to approximately 1 kg [65]. Some studies have reported weight gain to occur in almost 100% of women [9]; others have reported lower prevalence. Weight gain in the range of 1 to 3 kg during the first year after diagnosis has been most commonly reported, particularly in recent studies. Earlier studies (prior to 1990) tended to identify greater weight gain than more recent studies, likely reflecting changes in adjuvant therapy (see later sections) and, perhaps, greater clinician and patient awareness that weight gain is a potential problem.  \n",
      "It was initially hypothesized that this postdiagnosis weight gain was related to overeating. possibly in an attempt to relieve chemotherapy-associated nausea. However, evidence supporting that hypothesis is weak and a number of other factors have emerged as being associated with weight gain. Summarized in Table 27.6, these factors can be grouped into several categories. The first relates to menopausal status. Young age, premenopausal status, and onset of menopause (as evidenced by cessation of menses or reduction in serum estradiol levels) have been fairly consistently associated with greater weight gain. The second factor that has been most consistently associated with weight gain is systemic adjuvant therapy. The use of chemotherapy (as opposed to no chemotherapy) has been associated with the greatest degree of weight gain (most studies focused only on those receiving chemotherapy).  \n",
      "Two studies have demonstrated that anthracycline-based chemotherapy is associated with less weight gain than non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy [85.97]. Longer duration of adjuvant chemotherapy (1 or more vears) in earlier studies may have contributed to the larger weight gain reported prior to the 1990s; older chemotherapy protocols that included prednisone and ovarian ablation [9.18] were also associated with greater degrees of weight gain, as were multiagent (vs. single agent) chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy combined with hormonal interventions such\n",

      "as medroxyprogesterone acetate [64] or leuprorelin [84] has also been associated with greater weight gain. There is some controversy as to whether tamoxifen is associated with weight gain. Two studies have identified significant weight gain [63,69] in women receiving tamoxifen and two have not [65,73]. Regardless, weight gain in women on tamoxifen is minor and may be comparable to that seen in the general population [65].  \n",
      "Weight gain has been reported to be greatest in women who have lower (as opposed to higher) BMI when initially diagnosed [68]. Psychological distress and/or a disinhibited pattern of eating (i.e., eating in response to factors other than hunger) have also been associated with greater weight gain [60,61,70]. High caloric intake has been inconsistently associated with weight gain; the majority of studies have failed to find an association [60,69,74,80]. Similarly, reduced physical activity has been inconsistently associated with weight gain [60,68,69,78,80,81,83,87]. Several studies have reported reduced resting metabolic rate in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy [60,72,78,87], suggesting that reduced resting energy expenditure that is not balanced by reduced energy intake may contribute to the weight gain seen in these patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been postulated as a potential underlying cause of postdiagnosis weight gain [97].  \n",
      "The nature of the weight gain that occurs during adjuvant chemotherapy has been investigated in several studies. Demark-Wahnefried et al. have provided evidence that this weight gain is associated with an increase in fat mass accompanied by a decrease in lean body mass, a pattern seen with sarcopenic obesity [83]. Sarcopenic obesity has been observed with chronic use of corticosteroids, prolonged physical inactivity, or hypopituitartism or hypogonadism, as well as increasing age and menopause. Additional studies have shown that weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis is associated with increased fat mass (although there is some inconsistency as to whether the increased fat mass is visceral or nonvisceral) and/or decreased fat-free or lean mass [66,72,79,80,86,87]. This suggests that weight gain during adjuvant chemotherapy is due to positive energy balance resulting from reduced energy expenditure (reduced resting energy expenditure likely compounded by reduced physical activity) with no compensatory reduction in energy intake.  \n",
      "Taken together, these observations suggest that interventions involving physical activity that would result in direct increases in energy expenditure, as well as secondary increases in resting energy expenditure as a result of increases in lean body mass (i.e., muscle mass), might be most useful in preventing weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis. In this regard, our group has conducted a phase II intervention study of a multidisciplinary weight management intervention in locoregional breast cancer. The intervention included physical activity and dietary intervention  \n",

      "(reduced calories) as well as psychosocial support. The most important predictor of successful weight management was physical activity; the likelihood of successful weight management increased 78% with every 30 additional minutes of physical activity weekly [98]. Furthermore, Winningham [75] has demonstrated that increases in physical activity during chemotherapy are associated with increases in lean mass.  \n",
      "Prognostic effects of weight gain have been examined in seven studies [9,16,58,59,69,71,99] (see Table 27.7). The average weight gain reported in these studies has varied from 1.21 kg over 1 year to more than 10 kg over 1 year. Three of these studies have identified adverse prognostic effects of postdiagnosis weight gain [58,59,99]. These three studies were those in which average weight gain was the largest, varying from 5.9 to more than 10 kg. These observations suggest that weight gain postdiagnosis contributes to the adverse prognostic effect of obesity at diagnosis, but that the degree of weight gain must be considerable before this adverse prognostic effect can be identified. These observations provide support for the use of interventions to prevent weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis and strengthen the rationale for research to investigate the impact of interventions designed to promote weight loss after breast cancer diagnosis.\n",

      "A number of factors have been proposed as potential mediators of an adverse prognostic effect of obesity. The first of these, presentation of breast cancer at a more advanced stage in obese women, was discussed earlier. Although breast cancers developing in obese women are more likely to have unfavorable prognostic characteristics, available evidence suggests that adverse prognostic effects of obesity are independent of those prognostic factors. It has also been suggested that chemotherapy underdosing in obese women - a practice that may have been more common in the past than it is currently - may contribute to adverse prognostic effects of obesity [100]. It is possible that this has played a role in women receiving chemotherapy in the past; however, such underdosing (or dosing for ideal as opposed to actual body weight) is less common today. Furthermore, the majority of studies that identified adverse prognostic effects of obesity involved women who were not receiving chemotherapy, suggesting that this is not a primary mechanism for an adverse prognostic effect of obesity.  \n",
      "Hormonal factors have received the most attention as potential mediators of adverse prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer [52,53,91]. Obesity is associated with higher circulating levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women, due to increased peripheral aromatization of androstenedione to estriol, which is subsequently converted to estradiol, coupled with reduced circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased levels of free estrogen. This may contribute to adverse prognostic effects of obesity in postmenopausal breast cancer. Some evidence indicates that obese postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer experience a significantly reduced response rate when treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole [101]. However, increased estrogen levels are unlikely to be a central explanation for prognostic effects of obesity in premenopausal women in whom the ovaries (and not adipose tissue) are the major source of estrogen production. Furthermore, in one study [49], circulating estradiol levels were not strongly associated with obesity, were not associated with outcome, and did not mediate adverse prognostic effects of obesity in women with locoregional breast cancer; this suggests that other factors play important roles.  \n",
      "Recent research has focused on the role of insulin and other members of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors in mediating adverse prognostic effects of obesity [49,53]. Obesity is associated with the insulin resistance syndrome (also known as the metabolic syndrome) [102,103]. The relative resistance of insulin receptors in skeletal muscle and other tissues to metabolic effects of insulin leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia in an attempt to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. However, insulin and IGF-I receptors are overexpressed in breast cancer cells [104] and are not insulin resistant [105,106]. Activation of these tyrosine kinase receptors results in activation of insulin response substrate-I (IRS-I) [107] and downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (important in cell proliferation) and the phosphoinositidyl-3 kinase/akt (P13k-Akt) pathway (involved in anchorage independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis), leading to proliferation and growth [108-110]. The role of the insulin resistance syndrome in cancer risk is discussed in Chapter 20 [111].  \n",
      "Insulin not only interacts with its own receptor in breast cancer cells, but also contributes to regulation of IGF-I and IGF binding proteins. These entities, in turn, interact in a complex fashion with the receptors of this growth factor family, leading to further activation of the signaling pathways described previously. The relative contribution of insulin and the IGFs and their cognate receptors in these mitogenic signaling pathways remains an area of intense research interest [112].  \n",
      "Empiric evidence for an important role of insulin in mediation of adverse prognostic effects of obesity has been provided [49]. In a cohort of 535 women with newly diagnosed locoregional breast cancer, fasting insulin levels were strongly correlated with BMI (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). High fasting insulin levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence and death, independent of effects of BMI and other prognostic factors. Women whose insulin levels were in the upper quartile had a 2.1-fold increased risk of distant recurrence and a 3.3-fold increased risk of death compared to women whose insulin levels were in the lowest quartile. In the same cohort, circulating levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 were not convincingly associated with outcome [113]. Rose et al.[114] have recently suggested that leptin, an adipocytokine associated with cell growth, migration, and invasion as well as angiogenesis, may play a role in prognostic effects of obesity, perhaps in association with insulin. However, in the cohort study described above, leptin did not make independent contributions to breast cancer outcome [115].  \n",
      "It is unlikely that any of these mechanisms act alone. Insulin and IGFs contribute to regulation of aromatase activity and SHBG levels [116,117], and cross-talk exists between insulin/IGF signaling pathways and estrogen signaling pathways within breast cancer cells (this interaction may be mediated by the progesterone receptor [118-120]), leading to the possibility that these mechanisms act in concert to affect prognosis adversely). One potential schema for such interaction is shown in Figure 27.1.  \n",
      "Further research to enhance understanding of factors mediating adverse prognostic effects of obesity is urgently needed. Such research is expected to contribute to development of targeted therapies to reverse adverse effects of obesity. These interventions should be pursued in parallel to research that directly addresses obesity through a variety of lifestyle and possibly pharmacological interventions.  \n",

      "A large body of research has investigated prognostic effects of obesity in breast cancer. This research conclusively demonstrates that obesity exerts an adverse prognostic effect on disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. The effect is moderate in size, with hazard ratios for obese compared to nonobese women in the range of 2. This corresponded to an approximate attributable risk of 50% in one study [26], an effect that is highly relevant clinically. The adverse prognostic effect of obesity appears to be independent of stage at presentation and of other prognostic factors and to be present in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Some evidence suggests that it is probably present in women receiving modern adjuvant chemotherapy; however, further research to confirm this is needed.  \n",
      "Weight gain is common after breast cancer diagnosis; the magnitude of this weight gain has become smaller in recent years, likely reflecting increasing awareness of the phenomenon, as well as more widespread use of shorter term, anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which is associated with less weight gain. A growing consensus is that weight gain during adjuvant chemotherapy is due to reduced energy expenditure (reduced resting energy expenditure, probably compounded by reduced physical activity) in the absence of reduction in caloric intake. It is likely that interventions focusing on physical activity will be effective in preventing this weight gain.  \n",
      "The situation with respect to obesity at breast cancer diagnosis is somewhat more complex. It is likely that this obesity is due to a complex group of factors, similar to those seen in the general population - including excess caloric intake and excess dietary fat intake, as well as reduced physical activity - that have resulted in imbalances in energy balance. The positive energy balance that results in obesity at breast cancer diagnosis (and that may have contributed to breast cancer in postmenopausal women) is probably long term. In this situation, multifactorial interventions will likely be necessary. Such interventions should target energy intake and energy expenditure and may require psychosocial components to address motivational issues. Considerable work has been done to develop interventions targeting obesity in women with breast cancer. This work has shown  \n",
      "that physical activity and dietary modification are feasible and that modest weight loss is possible. These issues will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 34 and Chapter 35.  \n",
      "In parallel to this observational work regarding obesity and weight gain in breast cancer, there has been enhanced understanding of the pathophysiological basis for a contribution of obesity to breast cancer outcome. A number of hormonal mechanisms have been postulated, and empiric evidence supports the role of the insulin/IGF family of growth factors, which likely act in concert with estrogenic mechanisms.  \n",
      "Although much is known about obesity and breast cancer outcome, additional research is needed. Observational research to examine the effect of obesity as a prognostic factor in women receiving modern adjuvant therapies, including anthracyclines, taxanes, and aromatase inhibitors, is recommended. This research could be most efficiently conducted in the context of ongoing and completed randomized clinical trials. Additionally, research to understand the pathophysiology of prognostic effects of obesity will likely yield important information that can be used to develop targeted therapies in women unable or unwilling to lose weight. Such interventions could potentially include insulin or IGF receptor blockers. Finally, research will be needed to ascertain the benefits of weight loss after breast cancer diagnosis. Demonstration of a probable link between obesity and poor prognosis does not mean that reversal of obesity will result in improved outcomes; this must be demonstrated in well designed, randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, it is likely that a single intervention to promote weight loss will not work for all women with breast cancer, so evaluation of a variety of interventions and motivational approaches is warranted.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity are clinical indicators of energy imbalance or, specifically, excess energy intake relative to expenditure. Overweight and obesity are clearly associated with increased risk for several chronic diseases and conditions, including type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, and osteoarthritis [1]. In the general population, excess body weight also has been observed to be significantly associated with increased mortality from all cancers combined and for cancers of several specific sites [2].  \n",
      "Based on fairly consisting findings from numerous studies, obesity appears to be an important negative prognostic factor for women who have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer [3] (also, see Chapter 27, Chapter 34, and Chapter 35). Fewer studies have examined the associations between energy imbalance (as indicated by overweight or obesity) and recurrence or survival after the diagnosis of other types of cancer. However, this is an area of current interest, particularly in view of the increasing rates of obesity in the U.S., and studies that can address this issue are ongoing.  \n",
      "Several mechanisms to explain the association between overweight or obesity and prognosis following the diagnosis of cancer have been suggested. Alterations in metabolic and hormonal factors that may affect cancer progression, such as gonadal reproductive hormones, insulin, and other growth factors, are possible mediating factors [4,5], but other factors also may explain how obesity affects survival. For example, optimal surgical procedures for accurate diagnosis and initial treatment may be compromised by excess adiposity [6]. Chemotherapy regimens have generally been developed and tested in clinical studies involving mainly normal-weight individuals; the obese patient presents with altered body composition (e.g., increased proportion of fat to total body weight) and altered pharmokinetics due to obesity-related differences in hepatic and renal function [7-9].  \n",
      "In the studies that have examined associations between overweight or obesity and survival following the diagnosis of cancer, the subjects originate from different potential sources or pools, which influences the nature of the available data and the characteristics of the sample. They may be cases originally identified for case-control studies, cases that occur in clinical trials or ongoing cohort studies, or cases identified through hospital-based care and evaluated as a clinical series report (or retrospective chart review). In the reported studies, the effect of obesity on prognosis is typically examined using premorbid weight or weight at diagnosis. Thus, the issue of whether postdiagnosis weight reduction through diet and/or increased physical activity can modify the relationship usually cannot be addressed.  \n",
      "Also, overweight or obesity is not uniformly defined across these studies, and approaches used include calculating relative weight (weight for height compared with previously published optimal weight data) or comparing across subgroups using an arbitrary cut-point. The most common approach to defining overweight or obesity is based on the calculated body mass index (BMI, weight [kg]/height [m²]). BMI should be considered an indicator rather than a specific measure of adiposity; in adults, this index correlates better with total body fat at the ends of the spectrum than in the midrange [10].\n",

      "The relationship between overweight or obesity and prognosis following the diagnosis of colon cancer has been examined in a few studies. In an early study. Tartter et al. [11] examined cumulative 5-year recurrence-free rates in 279 stage III colon cancer patients identified over a 3-year period at a medical center in relation to weight, height, and an index of obesity (weight × 100/height²). Overall, patients above the median weight were found to be at significantly increased risk of recurrence (76 vs. 54%, p < 0.01), and women (but not men) above the median obesity index score were at significantly greater risk of recurrence (74 vs. 52%, p <0.01). Slattery et al. [12] subsequently examined the relationships among BMI, selected dietary factors, and survival in 411 colon cancer cases identified through two population-based case-control studies, with a median follow-up of 56 months. After underweight patients were excluded, increasing BMI was associated with a nonsignificant increase in overall mortality, although energy intake was found to be associated directly with survival.  \n",
      "Relevant findings were reported in a more recent study of survival in relation to dietary factors (but not obesity) in 171 cases of colorectal cancer identified through another case-control study [13]. In this study, high energy intake was again associated with increased likelihood of survival: 5-year relative risk of death for the highest vs. the two lowest tertiles of energy intake was 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07, 0.44). However, accurate estimates of energy intake are difficult to obtain with the dietary assessment approaches used in epidemiological studies, so the interpretation of these findings is constrained.  \n",
      "Within a large, randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial, the relationships between BMI and outcomes over a median follow-up of 9.4 years were recently examined in 3759 patients with stage II to stage III colon cancer [14]. Compared with normal-weight women (BMI < 25 kg/m²), obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) experienced significantly worse overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.07, 1.67) and a nonsignificant increase in risk for recurrence (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98, 1.59). BMI was unrelated to mortality or risk for recurrence in men in that study.  \n",
      "In another study that focused specifically on rectal cancer and used the same cut-points for defining obesity, the relationships between BMI and outcomes were examined in a target group of 1688 participants in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy clinical trial [15]. In that study, obese men with rectal cancer were more likely than normal-weight men to have a local recurrence (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.00, 2.59). However, obesity was unrelated to risk for recurrence in women, and BMI was not associated with overall mortality in men or women.  \n",
      "Based on the few studies reported to date, some evidence, although not conclusive or consistent, indicates that energy imbalance resulting in overweight or obesity may influence risk for recurrence and survival following the diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer. However, this is not an established relationship.\n",

      "Results of two studies that examined several dietary and nutritional factors, including obesity, and survival after the diagnosis of prostate cancer have been reported, both based on cases identified through population-based case-control studies. Meyer et al. [16] prospectively followed 384 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a median duration of follow-up of 5.2 years. When adjusted for known prognostic factors. BMI was not found to be related to mortality in that study. In a group of 408 men diagnosed with prostate cancer who were followed for a median of 4.9 years, Kim et al. [17] similarly observed no relationship between BMI and survival.  \n",
      "The relationship between obesity (defined by relative weight) and 5-year tumor-specific mortality also was examined in a clinical series of 235 men identified at a community hospital [18]. In that study, men who were at least 10% overweight were less likely to have advanced tumors. When they were subgrouped and examined by obesity and smoking status, tumor-specific mortality was lower in obese than nonobese nonsmokers, and in obese nonsmokers compared to all other subgroups (10 vs. 30%, n < 0.001): this reflects lower mortality in those with tumors of identical stages and a larger percent with less advanced tumors. In contrast, in a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological data from 860 patients, Amling et al. [19] found that obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) vs. nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m²) patients with prostate cancer present for radical prostatectomy at a younger age with higher grade and more pathologically advanced cancers.  \n",
      "The relationship between obesity and risk for biochemical recurrence (i.e., increasing circulating prostate-specific antigen) following radical prostatectomy was examined in one study involving data from 1106 men identified through a multi-institutional database, with a median follow-up of 33 months [20]. Moderate and severe obesity (defined as BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²), relative to lower BMI levels, was significantly associated with risk for biochemical recurrence (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.21, 3.27). Controlled for all preoperative clinical variables and year of surgery, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² was found to be significantly associated with increased likelihood of biochemical recurrence (n < 0.01): however, differences across categories of lower ranges of BMI (e.g., <25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35 kg/m²) were not observed.  \n",
      "Clearly, the divergent results from studies to date that have examined whether overweight or obesity influences survival after the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer preclude wellsupported conclusions at this time. Data from a large, ongoing randomized controlled trial testing the effect of supplemental micronutrients on the incidence of primary prostate cancer are expected to provide some additional insight relating to energy imbalance and survival [21]. Although incident prostate cancer is the primary endpoint for that trial, secondary endpoints will include prostate cancer-free survival and all-cause mortality. Extensive data on nutritional factors (including weight and height) are being collected as well.\n",

      "relation to intakes and BMI, adjusted for known prognostic factors. When compared across tertiles (<22.2, 22.3 to 25.8, and >25.8 kg/m²), BMI was unrelated to survival. However, the investigators noted that women with BMI < 20 kg/m² had a somewhat better likelihood of survival than the rest of the women, although this difference was not statistically significant (HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.48, 1.35).\n",

      "The relationships among overweight or obesity, tumor characteristics, and survival following the diagnosis of endometrial cancer have been examined in three retrospective studies. Anderson et al. [23] analyzed data from 492 women with endometrial carcinoma who were identified through a medical center database, with a mean follow-up of 4.2 years. Analyzed as a continuous variable, BMI was directly related to time to recurrence (p < 0.02), and a marginally significant protective effect was found for survival (p = 0.0645). Notably, the heavier patients were more likely to have less aggressive disease, indicated by a higher incidence of better differentiated, less invasive adenocarcinomas in those women in that study.  \n",
      "Similar findings were reported by Everett et al. [24] in 396 patients who also were identified through a single medical center database and had a median 27-month follow-up period [24]. No differences in survival were observed across three categories of BMI (<30, 30 to 40, and >40 kg/m²). Similar to the study by Anderson et al. [23], a beneficial effect of obesity (BMI > 40 vs. BMI < 30 kg/m²) on risk for recurrence was marginally significant in this study (p = 0.065), when adjusted for covariates such as grade, nodes, myometrial invasion, and stage. Also, patients with BMI > 40 kg/m² were more likely to have endometrioid histology, lower stage disease, and lower grade tumors than women with BMI < 30 kg/m². However, 23% of the women with BMI > 40 kg/m² who had complete surgical staging with lymphadenectomy were found to be stage II and higher, indicating evidence for cervical or extrauterine disease.  \n",
      "In a retrospective analysis of data from 121 women treated for endometrial carcinoma at a Polish hospital [25], obese patients (presumably those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) had a longer 5-year survival compared to nonobese patients (87.4 vs. 73.4%, p = 0.05). When examined across BMI categories, patients with \"mild obesity\" (defined as BMI 25 to 29 kg/m²) had the longest 5-year survival rate, and patients with \"morbid obesity\" had the same survival rate as normal-weight patients as defined by being in an appropriate BMI category.  \n",
      "Although only a few relevant studies have been reported, current evidence suggests that obesity may not be a negative prognostic factor for endometrial cancer. However, there are complicating issues in fully describing risk for recurrence or cancer progression in this patient population. Complete surgical staging via lymphadenectomy is sometimes not performed if the pathologic findings suggest that the patient is at low risk of recurrence [24]. In both of the two studies that addressed the issue, obesity was found to be associated with more favorable tumor characteristics, which suggests that the available data and the accurate interpretation of findings are complicated.\n",

      "The relationship between overweight or obesity and survival following the diagnosis of cervical cancer has been examined in two retrospective studies. Based on data from 175 patients diagnosed with advanced squamous cell cervical cancer at a medical center, 5-year survival was observed to be unrelated to obesity [26]. Although the definition of obesity in that study was not provided, obese patients reportedly had a 39% survival compared to 35% survival for nonobese patients.  \n",
      "In a retrospective review of 302 cases of primary cervical adenocarcinoma (stages I, II, and III/IV) at a Taiwanese hospital, the relationships between various prognostic factors and 5-year survival were examined for a median follow-up period of 63 months [27]. Obesity (although not defined) was tested for effect as a dichotomous variable (obese vs. nonobese) and was not significantly independently related to survival in that study.  \n",
      "Thus, both of the studies that have addressed the question of whether obesity affects risk for recurrence or survival in women who have been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer found no relationship. However, the approaches used to examine this issue were crude, and more data and analysis relating to this area are needed prior to drawing conclusions.\n",

      "Contrasting findings have been reported in two retrospective studies of the relationship between obesity and survival in women who have been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell vulvar carcinoma. Based on data from 50 cases identified at a Greek hospital, with a median follow-up of 61 months. Kouvaris et al. [28,29] found that overall survival was lower in women defined as obese (25,8 vs. 40,7 months for BMI ≥ 27 and < 27 kg/m², respectively, n < 0,02). In contrast. Kirschner et al. [30] found no relationship between obesity (defined as BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) and survival in 136 cases identified at a medical center, with a median follow-up of 69.3 months. Given the limited available data and divergent results from these studies, conclusions regarding a possible relationship between energy imbalance and survival in vulvar cancer would be premature at this time.\n",

      "Whether overweight or obesity is associated with risk for recurrence or survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma has been addressed in one study. Yu et al. [31] examined data from 360 renal cell carcinoma patients identified at multiple institutions; the majority of the cases had been identified in a prior case-control study. Obesity (defined as BMI ≥ 120% of standard BMI) was associated with later recurrence and longer survival in that study. Adjusted for other potentially prognostic factors, the hazard ratio for disease recurrence between the obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 (95% CI 0.19, 0.98) and the adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI 0.38, 1.22).  \n",
      "Data from 787 patients diagnosed and treated for gastric carcinoma at a Japanese hospital were examined to address whether obesity was associated with recurrence-free 5-year survival rates [6]. Investigators found that significantly fewer lymph nodes were removed in D2 and D3 dissections in patients identified as obese (BMI > 24.7 kg/m² for men and > 22.6 kg/m² for women) (p < 0.03). Furthermore, obesity was independently associated with shorter recurrence-free survival in T2/T3 cases in multivariate analysis (median 50 months vs. 69 months for high BMI vs. low BMI, respectively, p < 0.03), adjusted for other potentially influencing factors.  \n",
      "Some clinical data in the scientific literature have suggested that overweight or obese (vs. nonobese) patients are at increased risk for chemotherapy-related toxicity and adverse side effects, although the findings are not consistent. For example, examination of the clinical course of 262 patients treated for small-cell lung cancer with standard dose chemotherapies revealed no consistent associations of significance between increasing BMI levels and toxicity from therapy [7]. In contrast, risk of death associated with high-dose chemotherapy and autograph treatment has been found to be substantially higher in patients with higher vs. lower BMI in a few studies.  \n",
      "In a retrospective analysis of 121 patients administered this treatment, patients with BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 exhibited a risk of death of 2.9 (95% CI 1.3, 6.2) compared to patients with lower BMI, adjusted for other influencing factors [8]. In another similar study that focused on clinical data from 54 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, treatment-related toxicity and mortality, overall survival, and disease-free survival were all observed to be significantly adversely affected by obesity [9]. In that study, patients were grouped as obese (BMI ≥ 27.8 kg/m² in men and ≥ 27.3 kg/m² in women), underweight (BMI ≤ 20.7 kg/m² in men and ≤ 19.1 kg/m² in women), and normal weight or nonobese, and the underweight subgroup was excluded from the analysis of outcomes.\n",

      "Evidence relating to the effect of energy imbalance, as indicated by overweight or obesity, and risk for recurrence or survival following the diagnosis of cancers other than breast cancer is rather limited. For colorectal cancer, available evidence does suggest the possibility of an unfavorable effect of overweight or obesity on survival, but some inconsistencies have been found in the results of the studies reported to date. Even more divergent results have been found in studies relating overweight or obesity to recurrence or survival following the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  \n",
      "For cancers of other types, the current evidence is even more meager, with the evidence available consisting of very mixed results. Notably, the few studies relating to endometrial cancer that have published to date even suggest the possibility of a protective effect of obesity. Available data relating to cervical cancer are limited but consistently suggest a lack of effect of obesity on survival.  \n",
      "Given the established relationship between overweight and obesity and risk for other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is an appropriate recommendation for cancer survivors [32]. Regardless of a specific association with cancer progression, the well-established relationship of overweight and obesity, disease burden, and overall mortality provides a compelling reason to encourage energy balance in this target population [1].\n",

      "In energy balance, daily energy intake equals energy expenditure, and body weight and energy content (body composition) are unchanged. The daily energy expenditure can be divided into the following components (Figure 29.1):  \n",

      "Daily energy expenditure is strongly related to body mass and particularly to fat-free mass (FFM = body mass - fat mass) [1]. Also, fat mass shows a positive correlation with daily energy expenditure, but the slope (increase of energy expenditure per kilogram of fat mass ) is less steep than for fat-free mass [1]. Daily energy expenditure is also higher in men than in women, but the difference disappears after adjustment for the higher proportion of fat-free mass in men.

      "Basal energy expenditure or basal metabolic rate (BMR) is defined as the energy expenditure of an individual lying at physical and mental rest in a thermoneutral environment, about 12 hours after the previous meal. Resting energy expenditure is measured in less rigorous conditions than basal energy expenditure is. Therefore, resting energy expenditure is considered to be approximately 5% higher than basal energy expenditure. The mean energy expenditure during sleep is slightly lower than during arousal [1] and sleeping energy expenditure is about 10% lower than basal energy expenditure. However, despite small systematic differences, sleeping energy expenditure, basal energy expenditure, and resting energy expenditure are very strongly intercorrelated and the terms are often used interchangeably.  \n",
      "The strongest determinant of basal energy expenditure is fat-free mass, which explains up to 80% of interindividual variation [1]. The relationship seems to be linear, at least within a normal range of adult fat-free mass (40 to 100 kg). The maximal interindividual variation at a given fatfree mass is about 2.1 MJ, indicating the possible magnitude of difference in resting energy expenditure between two individuals with a similar fat-free mass. Genetic variation, body composition, variation of hormone concentration, energy balance and physical fitness are factors that have been found to explain the variations of basal energy expenditure, after adjustment for fat-free mass [2-5]. Physical activity, mainly strength training, may also increase absolute basal energy expenditure by increasing muscle mass.  \n",
      "Basal energy expenditure is measured in the laboratory by using the ventilated hood method [6]. This method is based on indirect calorimetry, that is, measurement of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation [7]. Measurement of resting energy expenditure is carried out in the morning after an overnight fast. Strenuous physical activity and alcohol consumption are not allowed on the day preceding the measurement. Smoking is not allowed and any physical activity should be restricted between waking up and resting energy expenditure measurement. The measurements are taken while the subject is in a lying or half-sitting position, with a typical duration between 30 and 60 min. Basal energy expenditure can be calculated from the calorimetry data in several ways. We have used a 45-min measurement. The first 15 min data are not used. The mean  \n",

      "Because of the technical constraints of basal energy expenditure measurements, determinations of energy requirements are usually based on predicted basal energy expenditure. Table 29.1 shows prediction equations for basal energy expenditure, as given by WHO/FAO/UNU [8]. Several prediction equations use fat-free mass, with or without fat mass, as the independent variable. However, because most individuals do not know their fat-free mass and accurate assessment of body composition is difficult and time consuming, it may be equally acceptable to use prediction equations with body weight as the independent variable, and age (group) and sex as classifying variables.  \n",
      "Oxygen consumption at rest is approximately 3.5 ml/kg per minute [9]. Therefore, a \"quick and dirty\" method to estimate resting energy expenditure is to use 1 kcal or 4.2 kJ per kilogram of body weight per minute. This is a very rough estimation, but gives an indication of the magnitude of resting energy expenditure.\n",

      "Diet-induced thermogenesis or diet-induced energy expenditure can be defined as the increase in energy expenditure above basal energy expenditure divided by the energy content of the food ingested [10]. The postprandial rise in energy expenditure lasts for several hours, but about 90% of dietinduced thermogenesis is observed within 4 h of the meal. Diet-induced thermogenesis is assumed to be 10% of daily energy expenditure in individuals consuming an average mixed diet and being in energy balance. However, the diet-induced thermogenesis of fats is only 5% of their energy content, whereas diet-induced thermogenesis of proteins amounts to approximately 20%. Dietinduced thermogenesis of carbohydrates is normally around 10%, but may be up to 20%, if carbohydrates are directly converted to fat (de novo lipogenesis); however, the latter does not normally occur in individuals consuming diets typical of European and North American countries [11].\n",

      "Note: The MET values and heart rates are only meant to be used as an approximate description. HR = heart rate.  \n",
      "Daily physical activity (and physical activity-induced energy expenditure) may be classified by using intensity (energy expenditure) or type of physical activity. Intensity is categorized from total inactivity to extremely vigorous physical activity (Table 29.2). Absolute energy expenditure is determined by body weight (basal energy expenditure) and intensity of physical activity, so heavier individuals may reach quite high energy expenditures with only moderate-intensity activities. Therefore, the intensity of physical activity is usually expressed as metabolic equivalents or MET values [9]. The MET value of an activity is obtained by dividing activity energy expenditure by resting energy expenditure. METs therefore show the magnitude of increased energy expenditure in relation to resting energy expenditure.  \n",
      "Inactivity is defined as physical activity with energy expenditure very close to resting energy expenditure. Many daily activities, such as slow walking, watering flowers, making food, washing dishes, etc., are light, without any noticeable increases in breathlessness or sweating. Moderate activities, such as brisk walking, vigorous cleaning of the house, bicycling, golf, and stretching, may induce a little sweating and an increase in the heart rate. Vigorous activities, such as running, swimming, ball games, and gym training, lead to heavy perspiration and breathlessness.  \n",
      "It should be noted that the individual feeling of strenuousness depends on training history and fitness. Therefore, an elite marathon runner may run 2 h at an intensity of 15 METs and regard this as \"moderate,\" whereas an untrained individual would be totally exhausted after running 5 min of the same intensity. An exercise intensity level of 10 METs is already subjectively very strenuous for a nonathlete. It may be read from Table 29.1 that energy expenditure for a 70-kg man during 1 h varies between approximately 70 kcal (290 k.) and 700 kcal (2900 kJ) , but that the consumption may even reach 1300 kcal/h (5400 kJ/h) for an elite long-distance runner.  \n",
      "Another classification of physical activity is based on the type of activity (Figure 29.2). The gross classification uses three subcategories - namely, occupational and leisure activities (excluding exercise) and physical exercise. Occupational physical activity varies between light (<2 METs) and heavy (5 to 8 METs) [9]. Although it is fairly easy to characterize some occupations as light (office work, predominantly requiring sitting) or moderate (waiter/waitress, predominantly requiring walking), most occupations are a mixture of all kinds of activities. For instance, although loading and unloading a truck are heavy physical activities, a major part of a truck driver's day is often spent driving - that is, in a sitting position with energy expenditure close to the resting levels. Recent trends indicate that physical activity and energy expenditure have decreased in all kinds of occupations [13].  \n",
      "FIGURE 29.2 Components of physical activity.  \n",
      "Exercise is a subcategory of physical activity: it is voluntary, deliberate physical activity performed because of anticipated positive consequences on physical, psychological, and/or social well-being [12]. Exercise may be divided into several subcategories (Figure 29.2):  \n",
      "- Aerobic exercise refers to activities such as running, very brisk walking, bicycling, crosscountry skiing, swimming, rowing, and paddling. The intensity is typically between 5 and 10 METs for nonathletes.\n",
      "- Strength training, typically done at a gym, refers to a wide variation of training protocols. Training with light weights (in relation to one's maximal load) and high number of repetitions result in improved aerobic capacity, rather than strength per se. However, heavy loads and fewer repetitions improve strength by neural adaptation and muscle hypertrophy [14]. Although the subjective feeling of strain may be quite heavy during a strength training session, the average energy expenditure is usually lower than for aerobic training (3 to 7 METs) [9].\n",
      "- Some types of exercise require more skills than physical fitness (e.g., playing golf, shooting) and the mean intensity during these activities remains often below 5 METs.\n",
      "- Ball games (e.g., soccer, basketball, badminton, tennis) are a combination of aerobic and anaerobic activity, strength, and skills. The mean intensity may be quite high (7 to 14 METs), but not necessarily comparable to very intense endurance sports.  \n",
      "Leisure physical activity is defined in this chapter as all physical activity outside occupational hours, but excluding physical exercise. Therefore, leisure physical activity comes close to the term lifestyle activity [15,16]. One of the main differences between exercise and other leisure activities is motivation: the main motive for exercise is usually exercise by itself or the anticipated physical, psychological, and/or social consequences of exercise. However, lifestyle physical activities are carried out in order to achieve something else, such as going from home to work, shopping, cleaning the house or garden, or enjoying nature. Lifestyle activity is often incorporated into one's daily schedule, but exercising may require a \"spare\" hour or even more [15]. The intensity of leisure physical activity is usually low to moderate, typically between 2 and 5 METs.  \n",
      "Inactivity means a state with energy expenditure close to resting energy expenditure. In everyday life, inactivity means sitting and lying while awake. However, the difference between resting energy expenditure and energy expenditure during inactive waking hours is not always the same. Some individuals have an unconscious habit of spontaneous, involuntary muscle movements, such as fidgeting. This is sometimes referred to as nonexercise activity thermogenesis. Although the increase in energy expenditure due to fidgeting and other small movements is not large in absolute terms, some studies have related this kind of an activity to improved weight control [17]. Because of limited data, more studies are needed to confirm the potential importance of nonexercise activity thermogenesis.  \n",
      "An important question is how much energy expenditure can be increased by physical activity. This is illustrated by calculations presented in Table 29.3. The example uses a hypothetical person with resting energy expenditure of 1500 kcal/day (6.3 MJ) - that is, a very lean man (55 to 60 kg) or a heavier woman (70 to 75 kg). The daily activities are classified as sleep, occupation, leisure (inactivity and light activities), walking, and running. In the \"basic\" column, the individual is assumed to be involved in very light occupation (mostly sitting throughout the day), without any leisure activities. The daily physical activity level (PAL) is obtained by summing the products of intensity (as METs) and duration of all daily activity types and then dividing this sum by 24. Total daily energy expenditure is then obtained by multiplying the daily physical activity level by the resting energy expenditure. The basic example shows a very low daily physical activity level (PAL < 1.4).  \n",
      "The next column illustrates a situation with 30 min of brisk walking instead of leisure inactivity. This amount is close to the basic recommendation for health-enhancing physical activity [18]. According to the calculation, this adds about 6% or 120 kcal to the daily energy expenditure. Running for 30 min, instead of walking, leads to a 13% increase in daily energy expenditure. However, if running substitutes light activities - not complete inactivity - the increase in daily energy expenditure is slightly less. When walking and running are performed for 30 min daily, the increase in energy expenditure is 18% or 380 kcal. The last column shows the effect of slightly increased occupational activity: if half of the working day requires easy walking, instead of sitting (mean MET increases from 1.5 to 2.0), the daily energy expenditure is increased by 12%. This shows that small changes in occupational activity may lead to considerable changes in daily energy requirements.  \n",
      "As shown in Table 29.3, increased physical activity rarely increases daily energy expenditure by more than 20% or 400 kcal. This should be related to dietary changes that may induce an energy deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/day. Although approximately 400 kcal/day or 3000 kcal/week may be regarded as a practical upper limit for leisure physical activity and exercise energy expenditure in nonathletes, higher values are obviously possible. Some randomized trials have achieved considerable energy expenditures (e.g., 700 to 1000 kcal/day) even in untrained and obese individuals, but the sustainability of this kind of an activity is questionable. Athletes, on the other hand, may use from 1000 to 5000 kcal in daily training [19-21].\n",

      "The previous part of this chapter was related to physical activity and total energy expenditure. Although muscle work always increases total energy expenditure, the use of energy substrates depends on the intensity level. Figure 29.3 illustrates the relative contribution of fats and carbohydrates during activities of different intensities [22]. As the intensity is increased from light levels to above 30 to 40% VO, max (i.e., shift from light to moderate), two changes take place: the muscle starts to use more intramuscular substrates (fats and carbohydrates) and, especially, the use of muscle glycogen is increased. It is possible that the use of intramuscular substrates is a prerequisite for metabolic adaptations and many health benefits of physical activity (see the section on physical\n",

      "activity and metabolic health in this chapter). When the intensity reaches 65 to 75% VO2 max (i.e., shift from moderate to vigorous), muscle glycogen becomes the predominant energy source. It is conceivable that the oxidation of fat cannot cover the total energy needs during vigorous activity and that intramuscular carbohydrates are needed when the activity level is high [23].  \n",
      "In addition to fats and carbohydrates, protein is also used as an energy source [24,25]. In normal circumstances, the share of proteins is less than 5% of total energy expenditure. Deaminated amino acids are oxidized, some directly in the mitochondria (e.g., branched-chain amino acids) and some after gluconeogenetic transformation to glucose. However, if muscle glycogen stores are depleted or if protein intake is much higher than the daily protein needs, the contribution of proteins may be much higher [25].  \n",
      "Although the use of energy substrates clearly depends on the intensity of physical activity, many other factors may also contribute. The duration of physical activity is one important factor, particularly when the intensity is between 40 and 80% VO, max - that is, when intramuscular substrates are used for energy [22]. Studies show a gradual shift from predominantly carbohydrate use (60 to 70% of total energy expenditure in the beginning) to use of fats (the share of carbohydrates decreases to 30 to 40% after 2 to 3 h). The use of muscle glycogen and intramuscular triglycerides decreases as the exercise duration increases [22]. Other factors affecting muscle substrate use are nutritional status (carbohydrate use increases after consumption of carbohydrates), training history, and muscle fiber composition (fat oxidation increases after endurance training and in individuals with a predominantly type I [\"slow twitch\"] muscle fibers [26-28]).  \n",
      "Some people believe that low-intensity exercise, with increased proportional oxidation of fat, could be optimal for weight reduction and maintenance. In contrast, some studies have found higher postexercise energy expenditure after high-intensity exercise [29-31]. Despite lay beliefs, the use of muscle substrate during physical activity has no relevance to 24-h substrate oxidation, energy expenditure, weight management, or body composition [32]. High-intensity exercise depletes muscle glycogen stores and leads to higher postexercise fat oxidation [28,33]. Conversely, low-intensity exercise with high fat oxidation is followed by increased postexercise carbohydrate oxidation, compared with a high-intensity exercise condition. This means that high fat oxidation during exercise is followed by low postexercise fat oxidation and vice versa. Total physical activity energy expenditure, regardless of the intensity, is therefore the important factor for weight management. However, intensity and the mode of exercise have some important consequences for health, which are briefly described in later sections on physical activity and metabolic health and on recommendations for physical activity and exercise.\n",

      "Exercise and leisure lifestyle activities are not necessarily associated. An individual may be an active exerciser but otherwise passive, or a nonsporty but lifestyle-active individual. Some individuals are active, or passive, in both behavioral domains. Unfortunately, only a few studies have analyzed the interactions among exercise, lifestyle activity, and obesity. Figure 29.4 shows the association between the two main domains of physical activity (leisure lifestyle and exercise) and the prevalence of obesity in 15 European Union countries [34]. About 15,000 adults were divided into five groups (quintile classification) according to the time spent in vigorous exercise and according to their leisure inactivity (the time spent sitting or lying down). Quintile 1 (EX1 or IN1) refers to those with the lowest levels of exercise or lifestyle inactivity, respectively.  \n",
      "The most active combination (high exercise activity, EX5, low inactivity, IN1) was used as the reference category (prevalence of obesity = 1). As can be seen from the figure, those with no exercise activity (EX1) and very high leisure inactivity (IN5) had a fourfold increased prevalence of obesity. Low leisure inactivity (IN1), together with low exercise activity (EX1), was only associated with a doubling of obesity risk, compared to the fourfold increase in the extreme situation. In summary, the message of this cross-sectional study [34] is that a combination of low lifestyle inactivity (= high leisure activity) and high exercise activity is optimal for weight control. Being active in one of these domains is, however, clearly better than total inactivity.  \n",
      "The main problem with cross-sectional evaluations is their inability to infer causality. Although randomized, controlled interventions are needed to show a cause-effect relationship, these kinds of designs are rarely practical in studying primary prevention of obesity. However, cohort studies or prospective follow-ups may bring additional insight to the role of individual health behavior or environment on weight change. A systematic analysis on the associations between physical activity and weight change has been carried out [35]. This review identified 16 prospective, observational  \n",

Results from the studies using baseline physical activity data were inconsistent. Three studies [36-38] reported that a large volume of physical activity predicted smaller weight change. High baseline work activity was associated with less weight gain in one study [36]. In contrast, two studies reported that a large volume of vigorous physical activity at baseline was associated with greater weight gains [36,39]. Finally, three studies did not find a significant association between baseline total physical activity [40,41] or TV/VCR watching [42] and the magnitude of weight change.  \n",
      "The results with physical activity data at follow-up were more consistent: Four studies found that a large volume of physical activity or exercise [38,40,43,44] at follow-up was associated with less weight gain. Only one study [45] did not find such an association. Many studies used data on physical activity from baseline and follow-up. About half of the studies reported that an increase in physical activity was associated with less weight gain [37,38,40,46-49]. In summary, this systematic analysis indicated that those who maintain or increase their physical activity also show the best weight control over a period of several years. Physical activity at baseline does not consistently predict weight change, perhaps because of changes in physical activity during the follow-up. Unfortunately, the prospective studies did not allow a two-dimensional analysis (lifestyle and exercise activity) of physical activity [34].\n",

      "The effects of physical activity on weight reduction, without a concomitant low-energy diet, have been evaluated in a considerable number of studies (for reviews, see references 50 through 53). A meta-analysis [51] identified 53 papers, published between 1950 and 1988, with randomized, controlled trials and with data on physical activity and changes in body composition. Dietary weight reduction programs were excluded. The average study length was approximately 17 weeks, except for studies with weight training (average duration 10 weeks in males and 12 weeks in females). Males lost 1.3 kg body weight in trials with running or walking and 1.1 kg in trials with cycling. The respective fat-mass losses were greater for running/walking (1.6 or 0.12 kg/week) and cycling (1.9 or 0.11 kg/week) trials. Weight training resulted in a mean increase in body weight (1.2 kg), but a reduction in fat mass (1.0 kg). Results for females were more modest: Body mass or fat mass changed significantly only after running/walking (-0.6 and -1.3 kg, respectively), but not after cycling.  \n",
      "Another systematic review [52] identified ten studies, published between 1983 and 1995, with comparisons of exercise alone with no treatment in obese subjects. A third systematic review [53] included studies with obese subjects, who were randomized into exercise and control (no diet) groups. Combining these two reviews [52,53] yields 18 studies. In short-term interventions (<26 weeks; n = 8), the mean weight reduction was 0.24 kg/week in exercising subjects and 0.05 kg/week in control groups (mean difference 0.19 kg/week favoring exercise). Long-term studies (≥26 weeks, n = 10) found only a 0.03 kg body mass reduction in exercising subjects and a 0.01 kg body mass increase in control groups (mean difference 0.04 kg/week favoring exercise).  \n",
      "A reduction in energy intake may be regarded as a core method during weight reduction. The additional effects of a concomitant physical activity program (most typically, aerobic exercise three to four times weekly, total training duration of 2 to 4 h/week, expected increase in weekly energy expenditure about 1500 kcal or 6.3 MJ) on weight loss has been studied in several randomized, controlled interventions (for reviews, see Garrow and Summerbell [50] and Wing [52]). A majority of the 19 studies identified by Wing [52] did not find any statistically significant differences between exercise + diet vs. diet only. Nevertheless, when all short-term (<26 weeks) studies are pooled, the average weight loss was 0.1 kg/week greater in exercising subjects. In long-term studies (≥26 weeks), the mean difference was 0.02 kg/week favoring exercising subjects.  \n",
      "Figure 29.5 combines the preceding two reviews [52,53]. The open triangles represent studies using a diet only vs. exercise + diet design. The filled triangles indicate studies with exercise vs. control (no treatment) design. It is clearly visible that physical exercise leads to a beneficial outcome, but that the difference to the no-exercise group is modest in studies with a longer duration. The apparent reason for this discrepancy is poor long-term adherence to exercise programs.  \n",
      "The largest improvement in weight reduction was achieved in studies with a rather high prescribed exercise level [53]. However, a clear dose-response relationship was only observed for short term (<16 weeks) studies. It seems that the enhancement in weight loss is linear up to a prescribed energy expenditure of 2000 kcal (8.4 MJ) per week. This energy expenditure level is achieved by walking briskly for 50 to 60 min/day or by jogging for approximately 30 min/day. Beyond this exercise level, the slope gets weaker. An apparent reason for this is that it becomes increasingly difficult to adhere to high-volume exercise prescriptions. In fact, it has been shown  \n",

      "[54] that less than 50% of the subjects with a target of 10 MJ/week or 2500 kcal/week (corresponding to 480 min/week) energy expenditure during walking reached this goal. Similarly, less than 70% of the subjects with a 4.2 MJ/week (1000 kcal/week) goal reached this level [54]. Other possible explanations are a reduction in physical activities other than the prescribed exercise program [55] or an increase in the controls' physical activity [56].  \n",
      "Figure 29.6 summarizes the results from a meta-analysis [50] on the effects of exercise, with or without diet, on weight and body composition. The results concerning weight compare well with those presented previously [51-53]. The inclusion of studies with body composition data brings some additional insight, however. It can be seen from the figure that the contribution of fat loss during diet-induced weight reduction is approximately 75% of the total weight loss. When aerobic exercise is used as the only means for weight reduction, the magnitude of weight reduction is modest but almost all is fat mass. Compared to diet, exercise improves the loss of visceral and subcutaneous fat [57]. Moreover, when added to a weight-reducing diet, exercise spares about 1 kg of fat-free mass, but cannot prevent a loss of fat-free mass [50].  \n",
      "Because the amount of energy expenditure is related to the total work done, it can be assumed that fractionization (dividing the daily activity dose into multiple, shorter periods) has no effect on weight change. Several studies have compared different kinds of walking prescriptions (long vs. short bouts; walking integrated freely into daily routines vs. structured and planned walking; at home or group based) (for reviews, see Hardman [58] and Fogelholm [59]). The prescribed duration for physical activity was 90 to 200 min/week. As expected, fractionization had a similar effect on weight loss to that of exercising one longer bout daily.\n",

      "Weight maintenance after weight reduction is more difficult than initial weight loss [60]. The effects of physical activity during weight reduction on weight loss maintenance have been examined in a systematic review [35]. Eight studies were accepted as randomized interventions with a prospective follow-up of at least 1 year's duration. The duration of weight reduction varied between 8 weeks and 12 months. Three studies used very low energy diet during the weight reduction phase; the other studies used a more conventional diet with restricted energy intake. All studies used aerobic exercise (walking or ergometer cycling) with a target duration of approximately 90 to 180 min/week.  \n",
      "Only one study [61] found clearly that exercise training during weight reduction led to less weight gain during the follow-up compared to nonexercising groups. In another study [62], weight regain was smallest in exercising subjects randomized to supportive telephone contacts during the follow-up. However, exercising subjects who were randomized to no extended support showed a tendency to regain even more weight than the diet-only subjects did. A third study [63] reported better weight maintenance in one physical exercise group (n = 5), but the finding was apparently caused by one outlier. In contrast to these results, four studies did not find exercise training to improve maintenance of reduced body weight [64-67]. The weighed mean results of these eight studies suggested that exercise during weight reduction slowed weight regain by approximately 0.02 kg/week [35].  \n",
      "The idea of introducing physical activity immediately after weight reduction as a maintenance intervention came originally from the group of Professor Michael Perri. In one of their studies [68], they used several weight-maintenance techniques, including aerobic exercise, in two groups All groups participating in the 6-month weight-maintenance intervention had less weight gain, compared with the controls who were not contacted after the weight reduction. Nevertheless, the exercise groups did not succeed any better or worse than the other weightmaintenance groups.  \n",
      "In another weight-maintenance intervention [69], 67 participants were randomized into exercise-focused and weight-focused groups after a 6-month weight-reduction period. The exercising subjects met biweekly in supervised exercise sessions and were also trained in relapse prevention strategies to avoid or cope with lapses in exercise. The weight-focused group learned problemsolving of weight-related difficulties, without emphasis on physical activity. During the unsupervised follow-up (6 months), the exercise-group gained more weight than the weight-focused group.  \n",
      "In our study [70], weight-reduced, but still overweight or obese, women were randomized into control, moderate-walking (target activity energy expenditure 4.2 MJ/week), and heavy-walking (8.4 MJ/week) groups for a 9-month intervention period. All groups received diet counseling. Compared with the end of weight reduction, weight regain at the 2-year follow-up was 3.5 kg (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 6.8) less in the moderate-walking group vs. control subjects. The heavywalking group did not differ from the controls.  \n",
      "A more recent study investigated whether walking or resistance training after weight reduction prevents weight regain in males [56]. A 2-month weight reduction by very low energy diet was followed by a 6-month weight-maintenance intervention and 23 months' unsupervised follow-up. Resistance training attenuated the regain of body fat mass during the intervention, but not during the follow-up. The walking subjects did not differ from controls.  \n",
      "Several observational studies and post hoc analyses have shown a positive dose-response between the amount (energy expenditure or duration) of physical activity and weight-loss maintenance (for a systematic review, see Fogelholm and Kukkonen-Harjula [35]). Some observational studies have estimated the amount of total exercise [71-73] or walking [56], which is associated with improved weight-loss maintenance. The results are surprisingly similar: an average exercise energy expenditure of 9 to 10 MI/week (2200 to 2400 kcal/week), corresponding to walking 70 to 80 min/day, seems to be associated with stable weight (±1 kg for more than 1 year) after substantial weight reduction. These estimates concur with a recent expert panel recommendation [74]. However, it should be noted that a smaller amount of walking may slow down, although not prevent, weight regain [54,69,70].  \n",
      "In summary, the expected weight loss with 150 to 200 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise should be 2 to 3 kg in studies with 3 to 6 months' duration. The enhanced weight reduction when this exercise level is added to a weight-reduction diet is slightly less. Thus, 250 to 300 min/week (or 35–45 min daily) seems more suitable for weight reducing purposes. This recommendation is close to the 45 min moderate-intensity exercise per day recommended in a recent report from an expert panel [74]. Splitting the daily walking into multiple, shorter (10 to 20 min) periods leads to a similar weight loss compared with walking an identical daily duration in one single period. For maintenance of reduced body weight, more than 60 min of moderate exercise per day after weight reduction might be needed.\n",

      "Physical activity has several beneficial effects on health [75,76]. The general relationship among physical activity, obesity, and health is outlined in Figure 29.7. It is remarkable that most benefits of physical activity are also obtained through successful weight control. This means that physical activity may prevent cancer, cardiovascular heart diseases, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and several musculoskeletal disorders by improving weight control. However, as clearly stated in the preceding part of this chapter, many individuals may find it difficult to increase their physical activity to levels that are clearly related to improved weight control. Therefore, it is extremely important to appreciate other health benefits of physical activity. Another way of putting it: physical activity can prevent major chronic diseases by improved weight control and by other metabolic responses, independent of body weight.  \n",
      "The next part of this chapter summarizes the most important dose-response issues related to physical activity and metabolic health. Those who want a deeper insight may read, for instance, the American College of Sports Medicine evidence-based dose-response symposium report [76]. In many cases, \"dose\" refers to the total volume, or energy expenditure, of physical activity. However, energy expenditure is a function of training mode, intensity, frequency, and duration. Some of these subcomponents of total physical activity dose may be important for the health benefits.  \n",
      "The American College of Sports Medicine dose-response report [77], together with another recent review [78], examined the long-term (at least 12 weeks) effects of aerobic exercise training and blood lipids. Both concluded that the effects of exercise training on LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are small. About half of the studies cited in these reviews reported a 5 to 20% (mean 7%) [77] increase in HDL-cholesterol concentration. A dose-response association between the prescribed volume of exercise and change in HDL-cholesterol concentration was not clear [77]; however, a threshold of 4.2 MI/week (1000 kcal/week) [77] and 5 MI/week (1200 kcal/week) [78] for a significant effect was suggested.  \n",
      "A meta-analysis [79] examined, among other factors, the effects of different exercise intensities (below or above 70% VO2 max) on blood lipids. The intensity category had no effect on triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, the exercise-related decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration was more marked after high-intensity (mean: - 0.16 mmol/L) than after moderateintensity (-0.07 mmol/L) training. The results of the Studies on Targeted Risk Reduction Interven-  \n",

      "tions through Defined Exercise (STRRIDE) support this conclusion [80]: higher training volume (distance covered: 32 vs. 19 km/week) was clearly related to beneficial effects on 12 indicators of lipid profile (including, for example, concentrations of LDL particles, small LDL particles, large HDL particles, and very low density lipoproteins). Intensity (moderate = 40 to 55% VO2 max vs. high = 65 to 80% VO2 max) had no clear effect on HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, or triglycerides; the high-intensity protocol was more beneficial on LDL-related measures.  \n",
      "Judged from the preceding results, vigorous aerobic activities may be superior in decreasing LDL-cholesterol concentration, whereas intensity is not equally important for HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. A minimum intensity is much more difficult to identify. One recent study [81] reported on the effects of an acute exercise bout on postprandial metabolism. The researchers had earlier found that a higher amount (duration) of moderate-intensity exercise was positively related to postprandial triglyceride clearance and insulin sensitivity. This time they used two exercise protocols with equal energy expenditure (1100 kcal), but varying intensity (light = 25% vs. moderate = 65% VO2 max). The subjects cycled for 90 (moderate intensity) or 240 (light intensity) min. Despite remarkable exercise energy expenditure and duration, the light-intensity bout did not have any effects on triglyceride clearance or insulin response to a fatty meal. In contrast, the moderateintensity exercise had a clear positive effect on both variables. These and some other data suggest that very light physical activities may not be effective in improving the metabolic profile, despite an increase in energy expenditure. However, more research is needed to clarify this important issue.  \n",
      "Physical activity, even without weight loss, improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance [82]. A meta-analysis of the effects on exercise, with or without diet, on type-2 diabetics [83] included 12 aerobic training studies with duration between 8 to 52 weeks. The amount of prescribed exercise (mostly cycling or walking) was 90 to 210 min/week in 11 studies, and 300 min/week in the remaining study. Exercise intensity was moderate. Using postintervention HbAn as the main outcome variable, the combined result was 0.66% units lower (= better) in the exercise groups compared with the nonexercise groups. Therefore, a clinically significant and positive response was observed. Weight loss in exercise groups was on average 1.7 kg larger in studies without dietary treatment and 0.9 kg larger in studies combining diet with or without exercise. These differences were not statistically significant. Although epidemiological data suggest that higher amounts of physical activity are related to lower incidence of type-2 diabetes, the data from controlled trials are insufficient to confirm a dose-response relationship [82]. Exercise intensity is probably not very important for glucose tolerance, but the answer to this question is still unclear |84 .  \n",
      "Physical activity lowers blood pressure immediately after an aerobic exercise session [85] and as a response to long-term training [86]. The response is associated with initial blood pressure; the blood-pressure-lowering effects of exercise are clearer in individuals with (mild) hypertension. Two recent reviews [86,87] analyzed the effect of different exercise intensities on blood pressure. Both reviews concluded that the blood pressure response to moderate, in contrast to vigorous, physical activity may be more favorable. However, the data are not very conclusive and even vigorous physical activity is clearly better than inactivity.  \n",
      "Obesity and high body weight have a beneficial effect on bone mineral mass and density. In contrast, obesity has a negative effect on many other musculoskeletal disorders, including muscle fitness and function, especially at older ages [88]. Nevertheless, the potential importance of strength (resistance) training in improving the general health and well-being of individuals with obesity has been undervalued. One reason for this could be the very small effects of strength training on body weight [50] and the belief that strength training does not have a positive effect on metabolic health. The latter belief can be disputed. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [89] has shown that strength training leads to a 3-mm Hg decrease of systolic blood pressure in normo- and hypertensive individuals. Moreover, other studies have confirmed that muscle hypertrophy improves insulin sensitivity, even in subjects with normal glucose tolerance [90].  \n",
      "The final issue is related to splitting the daily exercise dose, i.e., fractionization. Studies on fractionization have mostly used moderate-intensity physical activity [58,59]. Based on the available data, splitting the daily dose into shorter (10 to 20 min) segments has no apparent effect on blood lipids, blood pressure, or glucose metabolism. It is unclear whether the segments could be shorter than 10 min.  \n",
      "Several mechanisms explain why physical activity is beneficial to metabolic health. Figure 29.8 outlines the best known effects of physical activity on short-term and long-term metabolism [26,27,91]. Short-term responses include changes in transporter proteins (e.g., GLUT-4), enzymes, and peripheral vascular resistance. Changes in oxygen delivery and utilization and in muscle crosssectional area are achieved only after several weeks of training. The loss of adaptation follows an inverse order: transporter protein and enzyme activities are lost rapidly, whereas improved vascularization and muscle size remain for some weeks even during inactivity [92,93].  \n",

      "The recommended amount of physical activity for the management of obesity depends on several issues, such as the magnitude of desired outcome, recent history of weight change, and present individual physical activity level. The minimal amount of 150 to 200 min/week (25 to 30 min daily) moderate-intensity activity may improve cardiorespiratory fitness (in unfit individuals) and insulin sensitivity; however, a marked effect on weight, body composition, or fat distribution should not be expected. Increasing the total duration of physical activity to about 250 to 300 min/week (35 to 45 min daily) should bring about beneficial changes in weight, body composition, and HDLcholesterol. Possibly much more than 300 min/week of moderate physical activity may be needed to prevent weight regain after substantial weight loss.  \n",
      "All of the preceding recommendations should be interpreted as the desired increase in physical activity. This is well illustrated with the number of daily steps taken by individuals with different activity levels. Several studies show that individuals (normal weight and obese) without volitional physical activities (but excluding totally inactive individuals) take about 5000 to 7000 steps/day [70,94,95]. This corresponds to walking 4 to 5 km or 40 to 50 min. Thus, the \"30 min/day\" or \"150 to 200 min/week\" recommendation means an increase above the basic activity - that is, to  \n",

      "An interesting question is whether the set target level of walking (or any exercise) should be higher than the actual target. The justification for this question is that the actual completed amount of physical activity is often lower than the prescribed amount. For instance, in one study [54], the \"high physical activity group\" had a target of exercise energy expenditure 10 MJ/week (2500 kcal/week) or walking approximately 70 min/day. Out of this group. less than 50% reached the target. In fact, 22% failed even to reach the \"low physical activity group\" target of 4.2 MJ/week (1000 kcal/week) or 30 min/day. Perhaps the prescribed amount could be 20 to 25% higher than the actual target. However, the individual should increase his or her exercise levels only gradually toward these goals.  \n",
      "It has been suggested that the number of daily steps can be increased by 10% every 2 weeks, if the basic level is less than 8000 steps/day [94]. It is not known how fast the amount of walking can be increased, but perhaps the change should not be more than 2000 to 2500 steps/day or 15 to 20 min/day during 2 months. An increase of twice this magnitude is needed for clear health benefits, so an efficacious and sustainable walking program may not produce significant results until several months have passed. It should be noted that the data are inadequate to tell whether, because of injury risks and/or poor physical fitness, obese individuals need to progress more slowly in increasing their levels of exercise.\n",

As already discussed, the added impact of high-intensity activity (vs. moderate intensity) on weight and insulin sensitivity seems negligible (as long as energy expenditure is kept constant) [84]. High-intensity activity may have an additional positive effect on LDL-lipoproteins [79,80]. Nevertheless, some cross-sectional studies show that a combination of high duration of walking activity (or low duration of leisure inactivity) and vigorous exercise activity is optimal for weight control [34] and prevention of cardiovascular heart diseases [96]. Moreover, individuals who are successful at long-term maintenance of substantial body weight loss expend almost 30% of their weekly physical activity energy in vigorous activities, such as running [97]. Some high-intensity activities might simply be needed to increase the total energy expenditure up to efficacious levels. Perhaps walking or other moderate-intensity activities as the only mode of physical activity are too time consuming.\n",

      "Self-monitoring is a way to get immediate feedback. Pedometers (step counters) are quite inexpensive and simple devices for monitoring the number of daily steps. Unfortunately, some pedometers give an unacceptably biased result, from an underestimation of 25% to an overestimation of 45% [98]. Although systematic biases between pedometers are not very likely to affect monitoring of changes, it is important to be aware of potentially poor comparability between different devices. Accelerometers (movement counters) and heart-rate monitors with built-in equations for energy expenditure assessment are other possibilities for monitoring. However, a simple activity log (diary) may be as useful as these technical methods. Self-reporting is a potential weakness of an activity log, but the strength is that all kinds of activities are easily recorded. Cycling and gym training, for instance, are not accurately assessed by pedometers and accelerometers, and a heart-rate monitor is less precise in assessing light and very intense activities [99].  \n",
      "Poor adherence to prescribed exercise is a great problem in weight-reduction interventions. After 4 to 6 months, increased physical activity levels typically return toward baseline. This is observed in studies with an unsupervised follow-up [70], as well as during biweekly group meetings [100]. There is no panacea to increase long-term adherence to increased physical activity in obese (or weight-reduced) individuals [35]. Compared with group-based exercise, home-based exercise may improve long-term adherence [101]. However, Andersen et al. [71] did not find a difference in 1-year adherence between lifestyle activity (walking and other activities integrated freely into daily routines) vs. aerobics class groups. At present, the only advice would be to listen to the patient: some may find regular group meetings supportive, but others may prefer the time saved when walking from home. Moreover, it is important to tell the patient about difficulties in maintaining new activity habits.\n",

      "This chapter has outlined the main relationships among physical activity, weight control, and metabolic health. It is assumed that physical activity has a cancer-preventing effect by improving weight maintenance, as well as by metabolic effects independent of weight change. A recommendation for leisure physical activity and exercise must consider volume (energy expenditure during physical activity), as well as intensity, frequency, duration of a single exercise session, and exercise type. The following conclusions are therefore a basis for the recommendation:  \n",
      "- o Volume, duration, energy expenditure:\n",
      "- · It is apparent that a positive linear or curvilinear dose-response between physical activity and health exists, at least up to a energy expenditure during physical activity of 2500 kcal/week (10.5 MJ).\n",
      "- . The first clinically (and statistically) significant results on body weight and metabolic health are observed with a weekly energy expenditure during physical activity of 1000 kcal (4.2 MJ). Smaller amounts of physical activity may be beneficial (compared to total inactivity), but the results are difficult to show and they may be clinically insignificant.\n",
      "- A 1000 kcal/week dose is equal to 150 to 200 min of moderate or 100 to 120 min of vigorous physical activity weekly.\n",
      "- o Intensity:\n",
      "- · Vigorous intensity exercise (>70% VO, max) may be needed to improve the LDLcholesterol profile.\n",
      "- . Moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercises are equally effective in improving HDLcholesterol and triglyceride concentration.\n",
      "- Moderate-intensity exercise may reduce blood pressure even better than vigorous . exercise; however, the difference is not large.\n",
      "- . The intensity of physical activity should perhaps be at least moderate (>30 to 40% VO, max) to cause metabolic health benefits.\n",
      "- . Total energy expenditure and 24-h substrate oxidation are related to the amount of work performed, not to the intensity per se.\n",
      "- . Some studies indicate that a combination of lifestyle (moderate) physical activity and (vigorous) exercise is related to the highest activity energy expenditure and to the best health outcome. Perhaps a combination is the most sustainable approach on a long-term basis.\n",
      "- . Frequency and duration of a single exercise session:\n",
      "- · A suitable frequency for moderate-intensity physical activity seems to be daily and, for vigorous activity, every other day. This frequency means that a new physical activity session starts before all acute health benefits (e.g., decreased blood pressure,  \n",
      "improved insulin sensitivity, decreased HDL-cholesterol) have returned to their initial levels.  \n",
      "- · A preferred daily dose within the frame of a recommended weekly amount is 20 to 60 min.\n",
      "- · The daily dose can be split into shorter (10- to 20-min) segments without a loss of metabolic health responses.\n",
      "- o Mode of physical activity:\n",
      "- · The majority of studies have used moderate or vigorous structured aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, or bicycling.\n",
      "- Strength (resistance) training improves muscle fitness without compromising meta-. bolic health. Therefore, strength training is a natural component of a health-enhancing physical activity recommendation.\n",
      "- · Lifestyle activity leads, when performed at sufficient intensity, to similar effects on weight and metabolic health as more structured (aerobic) exercise with the same intensity and volume.  \n",
      "The old American College of Sports Medicine recommendation (aerobic exercise greater than or equal to five times, 20 to 60 min, per week) for physical activity was based on vigorous activity and improvement of cardiovascular fitness [102]. The new paradigm from 1995 emphasizes moderate intensity and daily frequency [18]:  \n",
      "- Every (U.S.) adult should accumulate 30 min or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week.\n",
      "- The recommended 30 min of activity can be accumulated in short bouts of activity.\n",
      "- People who already meet the recommendation are also likely to derive some additional health and fitness benefits from becoming more physically active.  \n",
      "Some ongoing walking promotion projects are using the number of daily steps as the main message and pedometers as the recommended technique to monitor the progress (\"10,000 Steps Rockhampton\" and \"Colorado on the Move\") [103,104]. In the latter project, the aim is to increase the number of daily steps by 2000. Although the \"30 minutes daily\" and the \"10,000 steps\" approaches are very straightforward and easy to remember, they may be criticized for being too simple. People may concentrate too much on lifestyle activity and walking; thus, the benefits of occasional vigorous activity and strength training may be forgotten.  \n",
      "The UKK Institute's physical activity pie was designed in 2004 as a new graphical presentation of the physical activity recommendations (Figure 29.9). The pie is strongly based on the consensus statement of Pate et al. [18] and other data on the relationships between physical activity and health (discussed earlier in this chapter). The pie is divided into two halves, each representing an energy expenditure of 1000 kcal/week (4.2 MJ). The bottom half describes lifestyle, daily, moderateintensity physical activities. The upper half describes more structured, moderate or vigorous exercise. These are divided into two subcategories, depending on whether the main outcomes are improvements in cardiorespiratory health or musculoskeletal function.  \n",
      "The recommendation is that either \"half of the pie\" (1000 kcal/week) is enough to offset most, if not all, of the diseases related to physical inactivity. For most individuals, the bottom half (lifestyle activity) may be the most sustainable approach. However, the \"whole pie\" (2000 kcal/week) is clearly optimal for weight control and metabolic health benefits. No special recommendations are offered for physical activity in prevention of cancer - prevention of all chronic metabolic diseases is achieved by approximately similar physical activity doses.  \n",

      "Obesity results from an imbalance of energy intake and expenditure. Currently, the obesity research community has placed a great deal of emphasis on energy balance as the key to achieving and maintaining optimum weight. However, energy balance depends on a number of physiological and behavioral factors other than total calories ingested or expended through exercise. Understanding these factors will provide new directions for nutritional intervention strategies that can be tested for their efficacy in cancer prevention. These factors include:  \n",
      "- Protein intake\n",
      "- Fiber intake\n",
      "- Total fruit and vegetable intake ●\n",
      "- Glycemic load of the diet\n",
      "- Dietary fat intake\n",
      "- Special foods such as meal replacements and portion-controlled meals\n",
      "- Dietary supplements that have an impact on energy expenditure, such as green tea, caffeine, and capsaicin  \n",
      "In turn, energy excess can stimulate numerous hormonal and inflammatory pathways that can promote the multistep process of carcinogenesis. The quality of the diet has some effects on these processes as well. For example, omega-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory by comparison to omega-3 fatty acids. The nature of the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates found in different foods and supplements has physiological effects, including the anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals and the effects of indigestible carbohydrates on hormonal balance. For example, soluble and insoluble fibers can affect the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens and the size of the body estrogen pool.  \n",
      "Insights on how to control energy balance through diet and other means may be of interest to those studying nutritional strategies for cancer prevention in populations and in individuals who have already survived the primary treatment of a common form of cancer.\n",

      "Epidemiological studies suggest that populations eating so-called traditional low-fat diets have a far lower incidence of many common forms of cancer than populations eating typical modern diets in industrialized nations. However, traditional diets have many other characteristics outside of their overall lower percent of energy from fat than diets eaten in industrialized nations to which they are compared. Among the differences are greater ingestion of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This difference in dietary pattern leads to a greater ingestion of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber and thousands of phytochemicals with cellular effects beyond antioxidation. In addition, the fibers from whole grains and lower intakes of red meat, sugar, added fat, and starch lead to reduced energy density of the diet, which has been shown to lead to satiety at a lower level of total calorie intake.  \n",
      "In the U.S., the intake of hidden fats in processed foods has increased over the past 20 years. At the same time, the intake of high fructose corn syrup has increased from processed foods. The result of these trends has been an increase in overall energy intake, which, in the absence of increases in physical activity, predictably leads to an increase in body fat.\n",

      "Protein provides a stronger signal to the brain to satisfy hunger than carbohydrate or fat does and is needed for muscle deposition, which can increase the lean body mass that, in turn, raises resting metabolic rate. A number of amino acids, including tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, have been theorized to affect the hunger control mechanisms once they cross the blood-brain barrier. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, it has been suggested that single amino acids or small peptides enter the brain to elicit their effects. Also, the small differences in the rates at which proteins release their amino acids into the blood stream can affect satiety. Voluntary reduction in energy consumption has been noted in subjects consuming high-protein meals compared with highcarbohydrate meals when fed ad libitum.  \n",
      "Researchers in the Netherlands [1] have studied the effects of protein on hunger perceptions by studying subjects in a whole-body energy chamber under controlled conditions for over 24 hours. Subjects were divided into two groups and were fed isocaloric diets that were high-protein/high-carbohydrate (protein/carbohydrate/fat, percentage of calories 30/60/10) or high-fat (protein/carbohydrate/fat, percentage of calories 10/30/60). Subjects reported significantly more satiety on the high-protein/high-carbohydrate diet, and hunger, appetite, desire to eat, and estimated quantity of food eaten were significantly lower. Less hunger was experienced during and after the high-protein meals. A higher diet-induced thermogenesis was also observed with the high-protein diet.  \n",
      "Westerterp-Plantenga further investigated the effects of dietary protein on body weight maintenance after weight loss. After following a very low energy diet for 4 weeks, 148 male and female subjects were randomly assigned to receive diets with either 18 or 15% of total energy from protein, representing a 20% higher intake of protein in the additional protein group. During this 3-month maintenance period, those receiving additional protein showed a 50% lower body weight regain, only consisting of fat-free mass, with increased satiety and decreased energy efficiency [2].  \n",
      "Another research team [3] compared a high-protein diet (25% calories from protein, 45% from carbohydrate, and 30% from fat) to a control diet (12% protein, 58% carbohydrate, and 30% fat) to evaluate weight loss over 27 weeks. Two groups of 25 moderately obese subjects were allowed to eat as much of either of two diets as they wanted. Weight loss (8.9 vs. 5.1 kg) and fat loss (7.6 vs. 4.3 kg) were significantly higher in the higher protein group, due to a reduction in daily calorie intake of approximately 16%.  \n",
      "Another study comparing the effects of a high-protein, low-fat diet (32% of energy from protein, <30% from fat) with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (66% of calories from carbohydrate, 15% of calories from protein, 30% of energy from fat) reported that the higher protein diet improved utilization of body fat while maintaining lean body mass. This study concluded that the increased proportion of protein to carbohydrate had positive effects on body composition as well as on blood lipids, glucose homeostasis, and satiety during weight loss [4]. A similar study comparing diets with 15 vs. 30% of calories from protein found that weight loss in the two groups was similar over the 6-week trial, but diet satisfaction was significantly greater in those consuming the higher protein diet [5].  \n",
      "Brehm [6] studied the effects of a very low carbohydrate diet and a calorie-restricted low-fat diet on body weight and heart disease risk factors in healthy women over a 6-month period. The very low carbohydrate diet group lost more weight (8.5 vs. 3.9 kg; p < 0.001) and more body fat (4.8 vs. 2.0 kg; p < 0.01) than the low-fat group. This study emphasized that the group with more weight loss was eating a low-carbohydrate diet; however, the protein content as a percentage of calories of the low carbohydrate diet was also much higher than that of the low-fat diet (28 vs. 16% of calories), which could also account for more weight loss due to increased satiety. In addition, the group eating more protein maintained a higher lean body mass while losing weight and a greater percentage of the weight that they lost came from excess body fat.  \n",
      "A meta-analysis by Eisenstein et al. [7] concluded that, on average, high-protein diets were associated with a 9% decrease in total calorie intake. The role of protein in affecting overall calorie intake and in body weight regulation in comparison to fat and carbohydrate needs further investigation. However, the evidence is strong that protein affects hunger-signaling mechanisms in the brain, induces thermogenesis, and contributes to the building and maintenance of lean body mass.\n",

      "It has been suggested that the increase in obesity in Western countries since 1900 may be related to changes in dietary fiber. Recommended fiber intakes of 20 to 35 g per day for healthy adults, and age plus 5 g per day for children, are not being met because intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes are below recommended amounts [8]. Fiber-rich meals promote early satiety, are usually less calorie dense, lower in fat and added sugars than meals typical of a Western dietary pattern, and characteristic of a pattern to prevent and treat obesity.  \n",
      "In clinical trials and observational studies, the intake of whole-grain foods, rich in fiber, is inversely associated with plasma biomarkers of obesity, including insulin. C-peptide, and leptin concentrations. Fiber-rich foods have a low glycemic index and glycemic load, resulting in lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels. In addition to promoting satiety due to their bulk, highfiber foods containing soluble fiber found in some fruits, oats, and barley may delay gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of macronutrients and may affect secretion of gut hormones to act as satiety factors.  \n",
      "Few direct studies on the relationship between whole-grain intake and obesity have been undertaken, although several studies report an association between whole-grain intake and insulin  \n",
      "sensitivity, which provides indirect support for the role of whole grains in body weight regulation. The relationship between obesity and fiber has been evaluated epidemiologically. Using food frequency questionnaires, obese men and women have been shown to have significantly more fat and less fiber in their diets than lean men and women [9]. In a study of normal weight, moderately obese, and severely obese subjects, total fiber intake was higher in the lean than in the obese groups and the grams of fiber/1000 kcal were inversely related to body mass index [10].  \n",
      "The association between dietary fiber intake and weight gain over time was examined in a prospective cohort study of over 74,000 female nurses. Their dietary habits were followed for 12 years and assessed and validated with food-frequency questionnaires. Women who consumed more whole grains consistently weighed less than those who consumed fewer whole grains; over the 12year period, those with the greatest intake of dietary fiber gained an average of 1.52 kg less body weight than those with the smallest increase in dietary fiber [1]. Similar findings were reported in the Iowa Women's Health Study [12] and the CARDIA study in which whole grain intake was inversely related to BMI after following subjects for 7 years [13]. Epidemiological studies also report that whole-grain intake is protective against cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes and has diverse potential mechanisms, including antioxidation and mediation of insulin and glucose responses.  \n",
      "The bulk of evidence suggests that dietary fiber decreases food intake and decreases hunger and that water-soluble fiber may be more efficient in this regard than water-insoluble fiber. Dietary fiber supplements (5 to 40 g/day) lead to small (1 to 3 kg) weight losses greater than placebo. Although the weight loss obtained with dietary fiber is less than the 5% of initial body weight felt to confer clinically significant health benefits, the safety of dietary fiber and its other potential benefits on cardiovascular risk factors recommend it for inclusion in weight reduction diets.\n",

      "Because fruits and vegetables are high in water and fiber, incorporating them in the diet can reduce energy density, promote satiety, and decrease energy intake while at the same time providing phytonutrients. Few interventions have specifically addressed fruit and vegetable consumption and weight loss, but evidence suggests that the recommendation to increase these foods while decreasing total energy intake is an effective strategy for weight management. Although obesity is often considered synonymous with overnutrition, it is more accurately depicted as overnutrition of calories but undernutrition of many essential vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.  \n",
      "The increased incidence of obesity has been associated with an increased incidence of heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer by comparison with populations eating a dietary pattern consisting of less meat and more fruits, vegetables, cereals, and whole grains. The intake of 400 to 600 g/day of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced incidence of many common forms of cancer and heart disease and many chronic diseases of aging [14-16].  \n",
      "The common forms of cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers, are the result of genetic-environmental interactions. Most cancers have genetic changes at the somatic cell level, which lead to unregulated growth through activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Reactive oxygen radicals are thought to damage biological structures and molecules including lipids, protein, and DNA, and some evidence indicates that antioxidants can prevent this damage.  \n",
      "Fruits and vegetables provide thousands of phytochemicals to the human diet and many of these are absorbed into the body. Although these are commonly antioxidants, based on their ability to trap singlet oxygen, they have been demonstrated scientifically to have many functions beyond antioxidation. These phytochemicals can interact with the host to confer a preventive benefit by regulating enzymes important in metabolizing xenobiotics and carcinogens, by modulating nuclear receptors and cellular signaling of proliferation and apoptosis, and by acting indirectly through antioxidant actions that reduce proliferation and protect DNA from damage [17].  \n",
      "Phytochemicals found in fruits and vegetables demonstrate synergistic and additive interactions through their effects on gene expression, antioxidation, and cytokine action. Fruits and vegetables are 10- to 20-fold less calorie dense than grains. They provide increased amounts of dietary fiber compared to refined grains as well as a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and a rich supply of micronutrients.  \n",
      "Several studies have sought to characterize dietary patterns and relate these patterns to body weight and other nutritional parameters. A prospective study of 737 nonoverweight women in the Framingham Offspring/Spouse cohort explored the relationship between dietary patterns and the development of overweight over a 12-year period. Participants were grouped into one of five dietary patterns at baseline:  \n",
      "- A heart-healthy pattern (low fat, nutritionally varied) ●\n",
      "- Light eating (lower calories, but proportionately more fat and fewer micronutrients) o\n",
      "- A wine and moderate eating pattern o\n",
      "- A high-fat pattern ●\n",
      "- An empty calorie pattern (rich in sweets and fat, low in fruits and vegetables)  \n",
      "Women in the heart-healthy cluster consumed more servings of vegetables and fruits than women in each of the other four clusters. Over the 12-year period, 214 cases of overweight developed in this cohort. Compared with women in the heart-healthy group, women in the empty calorie group were at a significantly higher risk for developing overweight (relative risk 1.4) [18].  \n",
      "In another analysis of dietary patterns among 179 older rural adults, those in the high-nutrientdense cluster (higher intake of dark green/yellow vegetables, citrus/melons/berries, and other fruits and vegetables) had lower energy intakes and lower waist circumferences than those in the lownutrient-dense cluster (higher intake of breads, sweets, desserts, processed meats, eggs, fats, and oil). Those with a low-nutrient-dense pattern were twice as likely to be obese [19]. Similar observations were reported utilizing data from the Canadian Community Health Survey from 2000 to 2001. The frequency of eating fruits and vegetables was positively related to being physically active and not being overweight [20].  \n",
      "In a controlled clinical trial, families with obese parents and nonobese children were randomized into a comprehensive behavioral weight management program featuring encouragement to increase fruit and vegetable consumption or to decrease intake of high-sugar foods. Over a 1-year period, parents in the increased fruit and vegetable group showed significantly greater decreases in percentage of overweight than in the group attempting to reduce fat and sugar [21].  \n",
      "Current NCI dietary recommendations emphasize increasing the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables from diverse sources such as citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, and green and yellow vegetables [22]. The concept of selecting foods by color was extended in a book for the public to seven different groups, based on their content of a primary phytochemical family for which there is evidence of cancer prevention potential (see Table 30.1) [23].\n",

      "Due to its high-calorie density, a decrease in dietary fat has been a target in conventional approaches to weight loss. However, the relationship between dietary fat and obesity has been brought into question for several reasons. Weight loss on low-fat diets has been shown to be modest, and prospective epidemiological studies have not been able consistently to correlate dietary fat intake with weight. In addition, obesity prevalence in the U.S. has risen dramatically since the 1970s, despite a decrease in fat consumption as a percent of total energy and the increase in availability of reduced-fat or fat-free foods [24]. Although dietary fat has decreased as a percentage of calories, carbohydrate consumption has increased; most of this increase has been in the form of refined  \n",

      "starches and concentrated sweets with a high glycemic index and/or glycemic load. This has led to increased interest in the role of refined carbohydrates in the current obesity epidemic.  \n",
      "In 1981, Jenkins et al. introduced the glycemic index as a system for classifying carbohydratecontaining foods based upon their effect on postprandial glycemia [25]. In this system, the glycemic response to the ingestion of 50 g of available carbohydrate from the test food is compared to the response from the ingestion of 50 g of the reference food (glucose or white bread). This is expressed as the area under the glucose response curve for the test food, divided by the area under the curve for the standard, and then multiplied by 100.  \n",
      "However, because the amount of carbohydrate in a typical serving of a given food will vary depending upon the food, the concept of glycemic load was introduced. This is an expression of the glycemic index of the food multiplied by the carbohydrate content of the food and takes into account the differences in carbohydrate content among foods [26]. For example, a carrot has a relatively high glycemic index but, due to its low total carbohydrate content, has a low glycemic load. In general, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, and legumes have a low glycemic load.  \n",
      "The intake of high glycemic index/glycemic load meals induces a sequence of hormonal changes, including an increased ratio of insulin to glucagon, that limit the availability of metabolic fuels in the postprandial period and promote nutrient storage [27]. This in turn would be expected to stimulate hunger and promote food intake. Short-term feeding studies have demonstrated less satiety and greater voluntary food intake after consumption of high glycemic index meals as compared to low glycemic index meals.  \n",
      "In one study of obese teenage boys, ad libitum food intake was measured for 5 hours following a low, medium, or high glycemic index lunch. Voluntary energy intake after the high glycemic index meal was 53% greater than after the medium glycemic index meal and 81% greater than after the low glycemic index meal [28]. Similar outcomes have been seen in other single-meal studies - for example, demonstrating prolonged satiety after consumption of a low glycemic index bean puree vs. a high glycemic index potato puree [29].  \n",
      "Weight loss on a low-calorie, reduced-fat diet may be enhanced if the diet also has a low glycemic index [30]; even when energy intake is not restricted, low glycemic index and/or low glycemic load diets have been shown to produce greater weight loss than conventional low-fat diets. Ebbeling et al. [31] compared the effects of an ad libitum, reduced glycemic load diet with an energy-restricted, reduced-fat diet in obese adolescents and found significantly greater loss of weight and fat mass among subjects consuming the reduced glycemic load diet. At 12 months, mean BMI and fat mass had decreased significantly more in the low glycemic load experimental group compared with the conventional low-fat group.  \n",
      "In another short-term (6 days) study, 12 men with abdominal obesity were treated with an ad libitum low glycemic index, low-fat, high-protein diet or with a low-fat American Heart Association Step 1 diet consumed ad libitum to observe the nutritional and metabolic effects. Men on the low glycemic index diet, but not the low-fat diet, had a spontaneous 25% reduction in energy intake, with significant reductions in body weight and waist and hip circumference [32].  \n",
      "Other data suggest that low glycemic index/glycemic load diets may confer protection against certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome, and type-2 diabetes. In the Women's Health Study, a high glycemic load dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk for colon cancer [33], and data from the Iowa Women's study indicated that a higher glycemic load pattern may be a risk factor for endometrial cancer incidence in nondiabetic women [34]. In a study of 244 healthy women, a strong and statistically significant positive association was found between dietary glycemic load and plasma C-reactive protein, a plasma marker for chronic inflammation associated with an increased risk for heart disease [35]. In large prospective epidemiological studies, the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the overall diet have been associated with a greater risk of type-2 diabetes in men and in women [36,37].\n",

Several reports have demonstrated a positive relationship between dietary fat intake and body weight [38–40]; however, others have noted a decrease in dietary fat as a percentage of calories with a higher overall calorie intake in the U.S. with increasing obesity in the population [41–43]. Reports regarding the efficacy of low-fat diets to reduce body weight are inconsistent and, as yet, the role of dietary fat in the regulation of food intake is not fully understood. In short-term trials, a modest reduction in body weight is seen in individuals randomized to diets with a lower percentage of calories from fat.  \n",
      "Randomized, controlled, ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate studies have demonstrated a range of weight loss in the range of 0 to 10 kg in the intervention groups, as compared to controls consuming their usual diet or a medium- to high-fat diet. Because of the large variability in outcome, the role of dietary fat in weight reduction has come into question. However, Bray and Popkin [44] found that a reduction of 10% in the proportion of calories from fat was associated with weight loss of 16 g/day, or 2.9 kg over 6 months, based on 28 intervention trials.  \n",
      "In a meta-analysis of ad libitum low-fat dietary intervention studies, Astrup et al. analyzed the relationship between initial body weight and weight loss. The analysis included data from 16 trials lasting 2 to 12 months and included 1728 individuals. Weight loss was positively and independently related to reduction in the percentage of calories from fat, although weight loss was not the primary aim of 12 of the 16 studies. It was concluded that ad libitum low-fat diets prevent weight gain in normal-weight subjects and consistently cause weight loss in overweight subjects [45]. A longitudinal study in 54 postmenopausal women demonstrated that a very low fat diet (<15% of energy intake) consumed ad libitum over an 8-month period produced a mean weight loss of 8% and a 2.7% reduction in body fat [46].  \n",
      "Obese individuals are at an increased risk for a number of diseases related to inflammation, and adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes a range in inflammatory mediators. Circulating concentrations of these cytokines are increased in obesity, and it has been shown that plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are associated with obesity [47] and decrease with weight loss [48,49]. Abdominal obesity is specifically associated with increases in cytokine concentrations in addition to the effects of body weight [47] and is one of the defining features of the metabolic syndrome.  \n",
      "Human beings evolved on a diet with a favorable balance of ω-6:00-3 of approximately 4:1, but the current Western diet has a ratio estimated at 16.74 [50]. The ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities; among the 0-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), those from fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) are more biologically potent than 0-linolenic acid (ALA). Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies have indicated that ω-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.  \n",
      "There are various sources of 0-3 and 0-6 PUFA in the diet. Green leafy vegetables and nuts are rich in α-linolenic acid (a precursor of ω-3 PUFA), and the long-chain ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) are found in fish oils such as salmon, mackerel, and herring. The ω-6 PUFAs occur mostly in the diet as linoleic acid and can be found in vegetable oils, with corn oil contributing the majority of lineoleic acid in the American diet.  \n",
      "In animal studies, the anti-inflammatory effects of 0-3 PUFA have been demonstrated by the measurement of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 [51,52]. Human ω-3 PUFA intervention studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis [53] and Crohn's disease [54], and @-3 PUFA has been shown to alleviate symptoms of these diseases.  \n",
      "Inflammation may be an important modulator of the relationship between obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The mechanisms through which obesity is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease may in part be mediated through inflammation. Some preliminary evidence now suggests that dietary w-3 PUFA can modulate at least some aspects of disease risk.\n",

      "Portion control is one of the primary strategies in calorie control. Many people do not take the time to weigh and measure foods or they may abandon this practice after a period of time, thinking that they can estimate portions fairly well. Typical diet plans specify what foods are to be consumed for meals and snacks, and portion sizes are usually specified in standard weights and measures. Practical problems may arise with patients, such as whether to weigh foods before or after cooking or failure to account for condiments or ingredients used in cooking.  \n",
      "A few small mistakes over the course of a day or week can have a significant impact on weight loss progress. For example, an extra few ounces of meat could add an extra 200 cal to a day's intake, and calories in cereals range widely - from 50 to over 400 cal per cup. In restaurants, portions are almost always much larger than those specified on a meal plan, and fats and oils, sauces, dressings, gravies, and other high-fat ingredients are not always evident.  \n",
      "Meal replacements are foods designed to take the place of a meal while at the same time providing nutrients within a known calorie limit. These can take the form of shakes, bars, soups, or frozen portion-controlled meals; they provide security to the patient due to a defined calorie and nutrient content. Meal replacements have been shown to produce weight loss results superior to calorie counting. In a study by Ditschuneit et al. [55], patients were divided into two groups: one  \n",
      "consumed an all-food diet of between 1200 and 1500 cal per day and the other consumed two meal replacements as part of an overall diet plan of 1200 to 1500 cal.  \n",
      "The all-food group lost approximately 3 lb over the first 12 weeks, and the meal replacement group lost approximately 17 lb. The markedly increased weight loss in the meal replacement group over the first 12 weeks was attributed to the enhanced dietary compliance mediated by the use of meal replacements. Both groups were then given one meal replacement per day over the course of 2 years and both groups lost additional weight. Ditschuneit and colleagues have shown that this approach can be maintained for up to 4 years [56].  \n",
      "In a 1994 study, 300 men and women at six sites throughout the U.S. took two meal replacement shakes per day as part of a 1200-cal/day diet plan for 12 weeks. For the next 24 months, they consumed one shake per day as part of a 1200-cal diet plan. Weight loss was about 7% of the starting weight, and subjects who continued to the end of the study (approximately 56% of the initial group) maintained much of their weight loss [57].  \n",
      "Heymsfield et al. [58] used primary data for meta- and pooling analyses from studies that compared partial meal replacement plans (in which one or two meal replacements were used daily) to reduced-calorie diet plans. Subjects prescribed the partial meal replacement or reduced-calorie diet treatment plans lost significant amounts of weight at the 3-month and 1-year evaluation time points; however, all methods of analysis indicated a significantly greater weight loss in subjects receiving the partial meal replacement plan compared to that in the reduced-calorie diet group. Additionally, the dropout rate for partial meal replacement and reduced-calorie diet groups was equivalent at 3 months and significantly less in the partial meal replacement group at 1 year.  \n",
      "Recent research has demonstrated that, with the exception of fruits and vegetables, increased variety of intake in all categories of foods promotes obesity [59]. By reducing variety, meal replacements help patients maintain a structured diet and portion control. Some meal replacements are excellent sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and may be superior to simply restricting conventional food intake if careful food choices, which would ensure nutritional adequacy, are not made.\n",

      "Obesity has been associated with low sympathetic activity [60] and caffeine has been studied in animals and humans because it can increase sympathetic nervous system activity. In genetically obese mice without endogenous leptin production (ob/ob mice), caffeine has been shown to decrease body fat and improve sympathetic activity, suggesting a possible role in the treatment of human obesity [61]. In a study of obese and lean humans acting as their own controls, caffeine in an oral dose of 250 mg increased free fatty acids and glucose, but not cortisol levels, compared to a water placebo [62]. Increases in oxygen consumption and fat oxidation have been demonstrated in normal subjects given caffeine 8 mg/kg orally compared to 0.5 gm glucose, as well as in seven normal and six obese subjects after 4 mg/kg of caffeinated coffee compared to a decaffeinated control after fasting and after a mixed meal [63].  \n",
      "In small studies, administration of caffeine has been shown to increase lipolysis, circulating fatty acid levels and oxygen consumption [64-67]. In one study, caffeine administration significantly elevated systolic blood pressure 4.5 to 6.6 mm Hg, but diastolic blood pressure or pulse rate did not change [66]; subjects reported no symptoms or side effects. The increase in resting metabolic rate induced by 4 mg/kg of caffeine predicts the amount of weight lost in response to a diet and exercise program, and the dose-response characteristics have been carefully documented [68-71]. Therefore, the scientific evidence in animals and humans supports a potential role for caffeine in weight reduction through increases in oxygen consumption and fat oxidation.  \n",
      "Several epidemiological studies have addressed the safety of caffeine. The positive correlation found between heavy coffee drinking and elevated cholesterol is felt to be due to factors other than caffeine in coffee because caffeine consumption in the form of tea or cola has no effect on cholesterol [72,73]. A clinical trial with 288 healthy subjects evaluated the effects of a single 200-mg/day dose of caffeine compared to placebo. Caffeine gave a 2.2 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure, which was felt to be clinically insignificant. Pulse rate or systolic blood pressure [74] did not change. Similarly, in women, the negative effects on osteoporosis of drinking more than two cups of coffee per day are associated with factors other than caffeine in coffee [75]. The FDA approves caffeine for sale without a prescription for use as a stimulant [76] by persons 12 years of age or older at a dose up to 200 mg every 3 hours (1600 mg/day) and as an ingredient in pain medications, which gives further support to its safety.\n",

      "Green tea prepared by heating or steaming the leaves of Camelia sinensis is widely consumed on a regular basis throughout Asia. However, the most widely consumed tea is the black tea consumed by more than 80% of the world's population [77]. Black tea is made by allowing the green tea leaves to auto-oxidize enzymatically, leading to the conversion of a large percentage of green tea catechins to theaflavins. The catechins are a family of compounds including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), considered to be the most potent antioxidant in the family of compounds. Drinking one cup of tea per day has been reported to decrease the odds ratio of suffering a myocardial infarction to 0.56 compared to that for those who do not drink tea [78].  \n",
      "These compounds are flavonoids in the class of polyphenols and have many activities, including inhibition of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades norepinephrine [79]. The catechins appear to be able to enhance sympathetic nervous system activity at the level of the fat cell adrenoreceptor. In vitro, a green tea extract containing catechins and caffeine was more potent in stimulating brown adipose tissue thermogenesis than equimolar concentrations of caffeine alone [80]. The use of ephedrine to release norepinephrine increased the thermogenic effect noted with green tea catechins. Oolong tea or placebo was orally administered to mice over a 10week period during high-fat feeding. Mean food consumption was not different between the groups, but oolong tea prevented the obesity and fatty liver induced by the high-fat diet. Noradrenalineinduced lipolysis was shown to increase and pancreatic lipase activity to be inhibited by the oolong tea [81].  \n",
      "Because caffeine occurs naturally in green tea extract, it has been difficult to separate the effects of green tea from caffeine in humans. However, a study by Dulloo et al. [65] gave subjects green tea extract capsules, three times per day, providing a total of 150 mg caffeine and 375 mg total catechins, of which 270 mg was epigallocatechin gallate. Subjects spent three 24-hour periods in an energy chamber during which they received the green tea extract. 150 mg of caffeine, or placebo. In the 24 hours when green tea was administered, 24-hour urinary excretion of norepinephrine but not epinephrine was noted compared to the caffeine or placebo-treatment periods. Energy expenditure was higher by 4.5% in the green tea period compared to placebo and 3.2% higher than when the same dose of caffeine was given alone. In addition, fat oxidation was increased. The net effect attributable to green tea could be estimated at 328 kJ/day or approximately 80 cal/day. Clearly, it is difficult to demonstrate the effects of green tea catechins alone, but a synergistic interaction with ephedrine independent of the caffeine content of green tea is possible and should be evaluated.\n",

      "Capsaicin from chili peppers and red peppers has been shown to stimulate fat oxidation and thermogenesis [82,83]. The exact mechanism for this effect is not known, but the constituents appear to activate neural signals that result in vasodilation and endorphin release. Ohnuki et al.  \n",
      "[84] have investigated the effects of capsiate, a nonpungent capsaicin analog found in the fruits of a nonpungent cultivar of pepper, CH-19 Sweet, on oxygen consumption and fat accumulation in mice. Capsaicin as well as capsiate increased oxygen consumption and serum adrenalin levels vs. controls. Additionally, after the administration of capsaicin and capsiate for 2 weeks, capsiate suppressed body-fat accumulation as well as capsaicin vs. control.  \n",
      "The effects of the same cultivar were tested in humans in whom core body temperature, body surface temperature, and oxygen consumption were measured after ingestion of CH-19 or a control pepper that contained neither capsaicin nor capsiate. The core body temperature and forehead temperature were higher in the CH-19 group vs. control, and body surface temperature increased for approximately 20 minutes after consumption of the CH-19. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher in the CH-19 group, suggesting that the nonpungent cultivar increased thermogenesis and energy consumption [85].  \n",
      "Tsi et al. studied the combined effect of capsaicin, green tea extract, and essence of chicken vs. placebo on body-fat content in healthy overweight subjects. The supplement contained 0.4 mg capsaicin, 625 mg green tea extract, and 800 mg essence of chicken. Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary and exercise habits and, after 2 weeks, showed a decrease in mean body fat percentage and an increase in resting energy expenditure in the treatment group compared to controls [86].\n",

      "In clinical intervention trials of low-fat diets designed to test the ability of nutrition to affect cancer incidence, the total caloric intake has not changed significantly due to the continued and increased intake of refined carbohydrates in compensation of lower fat intake. Typically, in studies such as the Women's Health Initiative, overall mean changes in body weight have been small, reflecting little change in overall energy intake or balance. Similarly, high-protein diets based on increased animal protein intake with controlled intakes of refined carbohydrates have not led to sustained reductions in body weight.  \n",
      "There are a number of strategies for affecting the overall dietary pattern while restricting energy intake through calorie restriction. The control of energy balance will continue to be of interest to those studying the relationship between obesity and cancer. Overweight increases the risk for several cancers, including esophageal, colorectal, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancers, and maintenance of healthy body weight and avoidance of weight gain in adulthood are advised. Further research into strategies for cancer prevention and the role of energy balance control is critical, given the current national epidemic of obesity.\n",

      "The case for physical inactivity as an important lifestyle risk factor for several site-specific cancers as well as other chronic diseases is now well established. Although research into the preventive health benefits of physical activity commenced as early as the 1950s [1], it has been only in recent years that the body of evidence has positioned inactivity as a major public health issue. In 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 million deaths and 19 million disability adjusted life years (DAYLs) were attributable to inactivity [2]. Conservative calculations estimate that 10% of breast cancer and 16% of colon cancer worldwide could be attributed to physical inactivity alone [3]. These are similar to other estimates; Mezzetti et al. [4] estimated that 11% of breast cancer risk and Slattery et al. [5] estimated that 13% of colon cancer risk could be attributable to physical inactivity. It is, however, likely that all these estimates grossly underestimate the true magnitude of burden due to physical inactivity because of the wide variation in measurement used and the unaccounted-for contribution of physical inactivity to increased body mass [6].  \n",
      "The economic cost of low levels of activity is also being recognized despite the measurement difficulties. Recent estimates suggest that, in the U.S., physical inactivity alone contributes as much as $75 billion to U.S. medical costs (year 2000) [7,8], and costs associated with inactivity and obesity accounted for 9.4% of the national health expenditure (in 1995). In Canada, physical inactivity is estimated to cost about 2.5% ($2.1 billion) of the direct total health care expenditures; a 10% reduction in inactivity has the potential to reduce these costs by $150 million [9]. In England, total costs of inactivity due to the direct costs of treatment for major lifestyle diseases and the indirect costs through sickness absence has been estimated to be £8.2 billion a year [10].  \n",
      "The public health response to physical inactivity has varied widely around the world. Several countries, notably Canada and Finland, have implemented major national initiatives for well over two decades [11,12]; however, for others, public health involvement and action at national and state/regional levels is much more recent. In 2002, the World Health Organization commenced the development of a global strategy on physical activity, diet, and health and this was endorsed by the member states in 2004 [13]. This reflects the growing recognition by government and nongovernment organizations of the role of physical activity in reducing noncommunicable disease and their need to help address levels of inactivity in the whole population. Evidence-based reviews of effectiveness of interventions have proliferated in response [14-16] and these summaries of what is known to work can assist governments in prioritizing their actions. Growing awareness of the trends in overweight and obesity, evidence of chronic disease in young children and adolescents, rates of urbanization, and changing patterns of transportation have helped accelerate the agenda for population-based programs aimed at physical activity. Media interest also has focused attention on these issues so that, now, countries around the world are beginning to take the importance of active lifestyles across the life course much more seriously.  \n",
      "This chapter provides a summary of the evidence base for public health action, an overview of the principles and content of a population-based approach, and a review of selected initiatives. This includes examples of communication campaigns, efforts aimed at creating supportive environments, programs in different settings, and a summary of recent developments in the policy arena. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive review of all intervention research on physical activity, nor is it needed. Interested readers are referred to other recent reviews mentioned earlier for critiques of interventions aimed at specific settings and populations.\n",

      "Population (or public) health is the organized, collective, or social efforts of society to protect, promote, and restore the health of the population [17]. It represents not a single action, but rather a combination of sciences, skills, and activities directed to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all people. The actions can and do change with changing technology and shifting threats to health, but the primary goal of improving the health status of the entire population remains the same [17]. In contrast, health care has as its aim the treatment or rehabilitation of illness.  \n",
      "The discipline and practice of public health has a long history, evolving over time to meet the health needs brought about by industrialization, urbanization, and, most recently, globalization [18]. Many countries with rapidly developing economies face the challenges of treatment and prevention of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Although the priorities and foci of public health action vary around the world, the core functions of population health can be broadly summarized as (adapted from National Public Health Partnership [19]):  \n",
      "- o Measurement, analysis and communication of the health status and health needs of a population\n",
      "- Prevention and control of communicable and noncommunicable disease and injury through risk factor reduction, education, screening, immunization, and other interventions\n",
      "- Development, promotion, and support of: healthy lifestyles and behaviors; healthy public policy (which includes legislation, regulation, and fiscal measures); safe and healthy environments; and healthy growth and development throughout all life stages\n",
      "- Strengthen skills, competencies, systems, and infrastructure to achieve measurable improvements in health status\n",
      "- Strengthen communities through consultation, participation, and empowerment  \n",

      "A population-based approach involves thinking in aggregate terms rather than as individuals, which is more familiar to physicians and clinicians. The approach recognizes the multiple determinants of health and their complex interactions that affect health status and involves implementing strategies that address the entire range of factors that determine health. A population approach also includes identifying vulnerable populations and directing efforts to address the differences in health status between groups within populations. More recently, the pressing need to accelerate understanding of and intervention on the social, behavioral, economic, and political inequalities that generate health inequalities is being recognized [18].  \n",
      "The underlying principles of a population health-based approach in practice include a strong commitment to working in partnership with communities and other organizations, the use of the best available evidence for action, and a focus on achieving sustained action and investment in long-term health outcomes [21]. In practice, a population-based approach comprises universal strategies aimed at all people and targeted programs for those who are most vulnerable [19]. The latter aims at addressing the identified gaps in health status between subgroups in the population.\n",

      "The role of physical activity in the prevention of specific cancers has received considerable attention in recent years [6,22-25]. Overall, the findings are consistent. Colon cancer risk decreases with increased levels of physical activity. The risk reduction for physically active men and women is around 30 to 40%, compared with that for inactive people [6]. Although the evidence base on the exact amount of activity required is modest, it appears that 30 to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise is required to decrease risk [25]. Furthermore, a dose-response relationship is apparent, with risk declining with higher levels of activity. Available evidence indicates that physical activity is not associated with a reduced risk of developing rectal cancer [6].  \n",
      "There is clear evidence on the preventive effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk. Physically active women have about a 20 to 30% reduction in risk compared with inactive women [6]. It appears that 30 to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise is required to decrease the risk of breast cancer and that a dose-response relation probably occurs [25]. These associations have been reported for pre- and postmenopausal women and in studies measuring total activity, fitness, and levels of walking.  \n",
      "No consistent evidence on an association between physical activity and endometrial, prostate, testicular, ovarian, or lung cancers has been found [6,24]. Further research is required to understand the possible associations with these cancers as well as to clarify the dose-response relationship between specific cancers and different types (frequency, intensity, and duration) of activity. The most recent evidence suggests that more intense activity, and increased frequency and duration of activity, may provide more protection. Although physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cancer, the mechanisms are still being investigated.  \n",
      "This brief summary of research indicates a substantial evidence base underpinning the need for a coordinated agenda of action at the population level to increase levels of physical activity for the prevention and treatment of cancer. For more comprehensive coverage of the evidence, readers are directed to other chapters in this volume and recent reviews [6,24].\n",

      "Nationally representative data on levels of participation in physical activity are available from less than one third of the countries [3]. Although most countries in Western Europe, along with North America, Australia, and New Zealand, have such data, in many other countries data are available only from selected regions or cities or not at all. Significant efforts to improve the assessment of key risk factors of cancer and chronic disease, including physical inactivity, are under way internationally and regionally [26]. The development of measurement instruments and methods (e.g., the STEPwise approach to risk factor monitoring) as well as the central collation of risk factor data worldwide [27] are supported by the World Health Organization. At a regional level, the first data on inactivity from several countries in South and Central America are now available [28.29].  \n",
      "The ability to track trends in risk factors over time has been hampered by the use of different measures and this is particularly true for levels of inactivity. However, again only in recent years, a concerted effort has been made to increase consistency between surveys and, when possible, comparability between countries. The international physical activity questionnaire [30] and the global physical activity questionnaire [31] are two different instruments developed for use as a brief assessment tool in population health monitoring systems. They provide overall and domainspecific estimates of activity, respectively [32].  \n",
      "In countries with data, notably the more advanced economies, the current pattern of participation is of great concern. In the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, less than half of the adult population achieve the current recommended levels of at least 150 minutes of activity per week. The proportion of adults reporting no physical activity can range from 15% in Australia [33] to 80% in Brazil [29]. Few countries have good trend data; however, where they are available, the results show mostly declining levels of activity (Australia) or at best no change (U.S.) [32].  \n",
      "Low levels of activity in many countries are of concern, as are notable differences between subgroups within the population. In general, findings from the national surveys show that levels of activity are highest for younger adults (e.g., the 18 to 29 years), but this declines sharply with age. Men are more likely than women to meet current recommended levels of activity, although it is known that these differences can disappear when different domains and types of activity are assessed. Adults with higher educational attainment are more likely to be more active compared with those with lower levels of education. However, this is seen most often with measures of leisuretime activity and may also diminish if other types of activity, such as transport-related activity (e.g., walking and cycling) and home-based activities, are included.\n",

      "Increased levels of participation in physical activity through a population-based approach comprising initiatives aimed at reaching everyone in the community, combined with targeted programs in selected settings to reach specific subpopulations based on need and inequalities, has considerable potential. Recent reviews have examined the effectiveness of various intervention approaches [14,15,35,36]. Furthermore, at least two ongoing systematic review processes are under way, one in the U.S. under the guidance of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services [37] and the other in the U.K. as part of the Health Development Agency's Evidence and Guidance Collaborating Centre work program [38]. The most recent recommendations from the work completed in the U.S. are shown in Table 31.1. Six of the eleven interventions reviewed to date are recommended for widespread implementation.  \n",
      "It is widely recognized that no single strategy or intervention will produce large changes in population levels of an activity. Instead, it is necessary to implement a coordinated, comprehensive set of strategies for investment over the medium to long term. Like other lifestyle risk factors, patterns of individual and population levels of activity are difficult to change, and isolated, shortterm quick fixes will not be sufficient.  \n",
      "A successful comprehensive approach to increasing physical activity requires action at the policy level combined with program interventions and a supportive environment. Gaining political and professional support as well as necessary community awareness and engagement is needed and can be achieved through the use of mass media (television, radio, and print) combined with strategic lobbying and public relations activities. The need to create healthy public policy and the need for increased provision of programs require action in areas outside the health sector (notably in transport and urban planning); therefore, it is particularly important that a comprehensive approach be undertaken in partnership with relevant government and nongovernment agencies and community groups. For instance, after-school activity programs may require the combined efforts of public and private education authorities, schools, teachers, parents, sport and recreation services, and local or municipal government.\n",

      "Developing a population-based approach to increasing physical activity can appear daunting. The demands of a comprehensive approach with multiple strategies and need to work in collaboration with nontraditional partners (i.e., those outside the health sector) are new and complex. Nonetheless, excellent examples of this approach are being put into practice in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Brazil, and elsewhere in South and Central America. Figure 31.2 shows one example of a planning and organizational framework for a statewide initiative to increase levels of physical activity.  \n",
      "The work in Western Australia (population 2 million) follows similar work in New South Wales, where a task force commenced in 1997 [39] soon after the release of the U.S Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health [40]. In Western Australia, a multisector task force was created representing a collaboration across state-level government [41]; it was positioned within central government (the premier's office) rather than within a single participating government department (e.g., Sport and Recreation, Education, Health, Transport and Planning). Such a move was strategically very important for several reasons:  \n",
      "- It positioned the initiative in close proximity of the highest decision-maker (the premier).\n",
      "- It avoided the perception of the \"problem\" and/or the \"solutions\" being viewed as the ● responsibility of a single government department - in other words, it made the high levels of physical inactivity \"everybody's business.\"\n",
      "- The relevance of the issue to many government departments' agendas provided a real opportunity for action at a cross-government level or, in current terminology, \"joinedup government.\"  \n",

      "In addition to senior government support, a strategic plan is an essential component to guide the direction and work of a multisector task force, along with a clear program of work with set timeframes, lead agencies, and identified partners. In Western Australia, day-to-day implementation of the work is undertaken by the Taskforce secretariat and three working groups (I Local Government, II Communication, and III Monitoring and Evaluation) comprising representatives from government departments, relevant nongovernment agencies, and academic institutions. More details on the work and progress in Western Australia are available [41]. Other examples of similar regional or state coalitions exist in Australia and elsewhere [42,43].\n",

      "Although the development of national policy on physical activity is a relatively new endeavor, several countries have a policy in place or under development. This has been strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization in its Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health [13]. A national policy on physical activity has been defined as [44]  \n",
      "... a formal statement that defines physical activity as a priority area, states specific goals and provides a specific plan or framework for action. It describes the procedures of institutions in the government, nongovernment and private sectors to promote physical activity in the population and should define the accountability of the involved partners.  \n",
      "A recent comparative study of several emerging national policies in 13 countries revealed a number of similarities in their approaches. For example, intersectoral consultation and partnership were considered an integral part of policy development process; multiple individual-oriented behavior change interventions and, to a lesser extent, environmentally focused interventions were proposed in various combinations. Leadership for policy development and coordination was usually within health or/and sport departments. Although links to other policies such as healthy nutrition and obesity were evident, connections to transport and environmental policies were less developed [44]. Notable gaps were present in policies in terms of specifying timeframes and accountabilities for implementation and no evidence of long-term funding to support implementation. To date, national policy on physical activity is rare and the most recent developments have yet to be evaluated.\n",

      "The role of the environment on individual behavior has long been recognized in theories of health behavior (e.g., social cognitive theory), but it is only in the past 5 years that it has become a major focus for those working on increasing levels of physical activity. In contrast, the development of behavioral interventions aimed at individuals in different settings (e.g., worksite, health care, schools) has received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. However, a prominent paradigm shift has occurred [45] and now researchers and practitioners are keenly interested in defining, understanding, and ultimately influencing the design of buildings, neighborhoods, and whole communities to create places that support engaging in physical activity [46]. This shift toward influencing the places in which people live and work has the potential to reach all members of the population and represents a real shift from the clinical (individual)-based model of health promotion and disease prevention to a truly population health-based approach.  \n",
      "The scale of interest in the role of the physical environment varies. Patterns of use of stairs in buildings have received attention along with simple interventions aimed at increasing use (such as point-of decision posters); these have proved to be quite successful in the short term [47]. The design of parks and public open space is also being explored - in particular, to understand and increase the provision of safe places for children to play [48] -because of their potential to provide opportunities for active recreation and leisure for adults [49,50] and improve public health [51,52]. On an even larger scale, the relationship between transportation systems and concomitant infrastructure (roads, highways/freeways, bike paths, rail and bus links, and public footpaths/ sidewalks) has attracted interest at the city or metropolitan regional level [53,54].  \n",
      "Despite the explosion of interest in the environment, understanding and empirical evidence are still at the formative stage of development. This is frustrating for practitioners who want to know today where to invest effort and resources and what urban design interventions represent the best buy. Sigmificant progress has been made on the measurement challenges of this new field and some of the early findings across a variety of studies are consistently showing that density of population, level of traffic, proximity to destinations and the aesthetic nature of the local environment are associated with higher levels of physical activity.  \n",
      "It is also apparent that the physical attributes of an environment that influence participation may differ for different subgroups and for different behaviors. In other words, what influences a young mother and child to walk to school will differ from what influences an older person to walk for recreation and a young man to cycle for fitness. These differences require future research to target specific behaviors in specific environmental contexts [49,55]. Meanwhile it remains too early for definitive advice on what interventions are more or less effective.  \n",
      "Although this is a new field, there are examples of initiatives aimed at improving the physical and social environment in different countries and at least one review [55]. Interventions aimed at increasing the use of stars and walking trails have been tested. In the U.S., trails have been built in local communities in southern Missouri, a deprived rural region. These have been built in partnership with the local communities and, in some cases, with private sector sponsorship; the results have shown increased levels of walking [56].  \n",
      "Large-scale changes to the urban environment are neither easy to gain support for nor quick to do. Moreover, they are usually costly. Therefore, it is recommended that these be undertaken opportunitistically and that they capitalize on the shared concerns within governments and in communities around issues with potential synergy with physical activity (and particularly walking), such as: improving air quality, reducing traffic and noise pollution, attracting business and building the economy, and enhancing the sense of community [57]. All these agendas share a common goal — namely, contributing to the improvement of quality of life and quality of a community. Increasing physical activity (as part of travel or for recreation) can be used to bring seemingly disparate groups and agendas together.\n",

Concerns of rising levels of obesity and diabetes and aging populations and greater recognition of the impact of the rapid changes taking place in the social and urban environment have focused attention on what action can be taken to halt and reverse the decline in activity levels.  \n",
      "Recent evidence-based reviews provide sign posts for the types of programs likely to be effective and, although not tested in every region of the world, they represent some of the current \"best buys.\" It is very clear from the evidence collated over the past decade that isolated, short-term ad hoc efforts are not effective. In contrast, comprehensive community-wide programs adopting the principles and practice of a population health approach offer the most promise. When such approaches are implemented at a national level for a sustained period of time, positive trends are possible (for example, in Finland, Canada, Brazil). Although most reviews of interventions on physical activity usually identify at least some successful elements, there is a call consistently for implementation of them within a comprehensive framework with sustained commitment.  \n",
      "In conclusion, strong evidence supports the importance of inactivity as a major risk factor for some cancers and other chronic diseases. However, more work is needed to improve the science and art of population-based approaches to promoting physical activity and calls for more research abound. Research into the biological mechanisms and the dose-response relationship should continue to inform public health recommendations. Measurement and comparability of data will hopefully improve. However, the greatest challenge remains in translating what is learned into effective population health approaches. Applied researchers, clinicians, and health practitioners, along with partners in nonhealth sectors, are encouraged to pursue the evaluation and, when successful, dissemination of innovative approaches, applying the growing evidence base to reducing the rising levels of inactivity.\n",

      "Many powerful and interacting forces in the current social and cultural environment have an impact on the physiological traits of individuals. The ability to maintain sufficient levels of physical activity (i.e., energy expenditure) successfully in order to counterbalance the excess of energy intake in modern society is a challenging proposition for many, if not most, of us. As a result, excess body weight is no longer the exception; rather, because more than 65% of the population is currently defined as overweight, it has become the norm [1-3]. Due to their increasing prevalence, overweight and obesity may be the most common conditions encountered in the primary care setting. However, patients are not visiting the clinic for their obesity per se. Because excess weight is so strongly associated with a host of medical conditions, many patients are seen in the primary care setting for treatment of obesity-related sequelae [4].  \n",
      "Primary care practitioners can support their patients in a variety of ways to address the challenges of dealing with overweight and obesity. Control of body weight depends upon a balance between food consumed and energy expended in the context of the natural tendency of the body to accumulate body fat. Thus, clinicians can help raise awareness of the importance of healthy nutrition and physical activity, motivating their patients to take action and facilitating access to appropriate programs.  \n",
      "It is the purpose of this chapter to consider the opportunity that resides within primary care to address overweight and obesity through physical activity and diet. It will discuss the clinical burden associated with obesity in the context of administrative and operational challenges and financial realities of clinical practice that call for extended care teams, identification of patients, counseling and referral tools, and effective operational clinic systems. A discussion of specific content related to diet and physical activity recommendations appropriate for weight loss and weight maintenance is beyond the scope of this chapter because they have been addressed in other chapters.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity are recognized as major public health concerns in the U.S. and many other countries. Since the mid-1980s, overweight and obesity rates have steadily increased among children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Based on measured height and weight among a representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. civilians, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) studies have monitored the prevalence of overweight and obesity since 1960 [1]. Current estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults using NHANES 1999-2002 data are outlined in Table 32.1.  \n",
      "Among adults (age 20 years and over) and children (age 2 through 19 years), the prevalence of overweight in 2002 was 65.7 and 16.5%, respectively [2]. In addition, obesity rates among lowincome adults are estimated to be almost twice as high compared to those of adults with higher incomes; rates are disproportionately high among African American and Latino women. Whereas the increase in prevalence of obesity has been rapid over the past two decades, the increase in prevalence of severe obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2) has outpaced all other classes of obesity. Between 1986 and 2000, the prevalence of severe obesity quadrupled from a rate of about 1 in 200 to 1 in 50, compared to a doubling in the prevalence of obesity rates of a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5) [3].\n",

In addition, overweight and obesity have been linked to increased risks of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, osteoarthritis, gallbladder disease, and several types of cancer including cancer of the breast, endometrium, colon, kidney, esophagus, stomach, and gallbladder [12].

      "Although total costs associated with obesity are high, excess charges appear to be incurred in a short timeframe as well. In a series of studies, Pronk and colleagues reported on the excess health care costs associated with obesity among older health plan members aged 40 years and over and active employees aged 18 to 65 years, and finally the indirect costs related to decrements in productivity that are associated with obesity. First, they studied the relationship between modifiable health risks and short-term health care charges in a random sample of older adult health plan members [17]. Results indicated that, after adjustment for age, sex, race, and chronic disease status, each BMI unit was prospectively related to 1.9% higher charges. In other words, for each incremental unit of BMI, excess health care charges increased by 1.9% during the course of the year.  \n",
      "Next, among active employees, the annualized health care costs associated with excess weight were studied based on BMIs calculated from self-report health assessment surveys [18]. In a sample of 8822 employees, after statistically controlling for age, sex, asthma, breast cancer, other cancers, diabetes, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, back pain, lung disease, and emotional and physical function, average health care costs for overweight and obese employees were 8% higher per year.  \n",
      "Finally, a study was conducted to examine the association between obesity and work performance, or productivity [19]. Work performance was considered in the absenteeism and \"presenteeism\" domains - that is, work loss days as well as decrements in performance among employees while at work. Obesity was significantly related to work loss days as well as an interpersonal relationship variable expressed as \"getting along with coworkers.\" Due to these studies, it is  \n",
      "concluded that obesity increases not only direct medical care expenses, but also the indirect costs associated with reduced productivity due to decrements in work performance.\n",

      "It is important to determine whether advice to lose weight through diet and physical activity results in an improvement of health status and management of associated medical conditions. Based on a variety of studies [20-24], it appears that modest weight loss and increases in physical activity are associated with a significant reduction in disease-related risks. Table 32.2 presents a summary of the positive impact that weight loss and physical activity increases have on a variety of diseases and chronic conditions. Detailed information on the recommendations to follow regarding physical activity and weight management is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, the following statement, as put forth by Blair et al. [25], represents advice supported by current knowledge that fits with clinical approaches to implement preventive counseling guidelines based on systematic reviews of scientific literature:  \n",

This dose of exercise may be insufficient to prevent unhealthful weight gain for some, perhaps many, but probably not all, persons. For persons who are exercising 30 min/d and consuming what appears to be an appropriate number of calories, but are still having trouble controlling their weight, additional exercise or caloric restriction is recommended to reach energy balance and minimize the likelihood of further weight gain. For persons exercising 30 min/d who are weight stable, we recommend that they try to build up to 60 min activity/d, which will provide additional benefit. In addition to aerobic\n",

However, to do so, physicians and other clinical personnel would need to overcome significant barriers related to addressing weight and physical activity issues [30]. These barriers, among others, include:  \n",

      "The primary care phvsician is in an excellent position to help patients address their overweightor obesity-related concerns. Routine contact provides ongoing, longer term opportunities for intervention and repeated advice and motivation. Patients who are advised by their physician to lose weight, increase their physical activity, or adjust their diet tend to be more willing to attempt weight loss compared to those who do not receive such advice [31,32].\n",

      "Brief interventions in diet and exercise in primary care settings have proven to be effective for weight loss. Among U.S. adults, 28 to 48% reported receiving physician advice on physical activity [33-36], although physicians from several specialties did not feel qualified or successful in treating obese patients. In general, counseling tends to be done more often and for a longer duration by physicians who feel comfortable and successful at counseling as compared to those who do not [37]. It is therefore not surprising that physicians who receive training in counseling their patients for weight loss have a higher rate of success in obesity management than those who do not receive training [38]. When the physician provides advice regarding weight loss, the odds of the patient  \n",
      "acting upon such advice were nearly three times greater than those for patients who did not receive this advice [39].  \n",
      "As it turns out, some factors or patient characteristics appear to be related to a higher likelihood of receiving counseling or advice about weight. These factors include [40]:  \n",
      "- Being a woman ●\n",
      "- Living in the Northeastern U.S. ●\n",
      "- Being below 60 years of age ●\n",

      "Another aspect of the counseling practices among physicians in the U.S. is the noted positive association between a physician's personal habits and the likelihood to counsel patients about weight-related lifestyle behaviors, such as physical activity or diet. Lewis and Wells [41] showed that physicians attempting to lose weight were significantly more likely to provide advice to their patients about weight loss and those who perceived themselves as overweight were less likely to counsel their patients. The majority (~90%) of family physicians in the U.S. believe that they should be role models to their patients when it comes to healthy weight. Unfortunately, overweight physicians were also much less likely to refer obese patients to dietitians and nutritionists [42].\n",

Are health care professionals advising obese patients to lose weight? JAMA 1999; 282(16):1576-1578.)  \n",
      "however, this approach also needs to be tailored to the willingness or readiness of the patient to take action on any or all of the risk factors that may be modified. Thus, the physician needs to be able to:  \n",
      "- Measure each of the risk factors and document whether advice is needed\n",
      "- Understand whether changes can be made in the risk factor that will improve the patient's health status\n",
      "- Provide counsel and advice to the patient about the options available or the action that may be taken\n",

      "- Support the patient in implementing the action plan\n",
      "- Provide an avenue for periodic follow-up  \n",
      "These steps can be summarized in the context of the \"5As\" approach that has been extensively used in addressing tobacco use and smoking in the primary care practice setting [43,44]. The 5As stand for assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange for follow-up. Table 32.3 outlines the steps involved in this approach and a brief discussion of their content.  \n",
      "When integrated into an office system, elements of the 5As (i.e., assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange follow-up) can be delivered at various points in the process of care (i.e., previsit, during the visit, after the visit, or between visits) by various members of the clinical care team (e.g., medical assistant, physician, nurse, health educator) across multiple visits or contacts. Thus, the role of the primary care clinician might be to use data obtained from a previsit risk assessment (assess) to provide a brief personalized motivational message tied to the patient's health concerns (advise). The primary care clinician might also encourage the patient to choose a behavioral goal and, if the patient agrees, address a specific risk behavior (agree); he or she can refer the patient to a system-based counseling service staffed by a health educator or other member of the health care team (assist and arrange follow-up) [45].  \n",
      "This type of integrated approach to addressing multiple risk factors in a clinical setting, in which multiple clinic team members have responsibility for different aspects of the 5As, eases the burden on the primary care physician within the context of time-pressured primary care practice. Limiting primary care clinicians' roles and responsibility to the advise and agree components of the 5As may be the most efficient way to utilize their influence while also enhancing their confidence regarding intervening successfully.  \n",
      "The assessment of a patient's readiness to change is another opportunity to optimize success. Because multiple risk factors are addressed, it is unlikely that the patient is ready to take action on all of them. For some, the patient may be contemplating making changes in his or her diet but not be ready to sign up for several sessions with the dietitian. However, the patient is ready to enroll and participate actively in a program specific to a single behavior (say, physical activity) by joining a walking club. In order to ensure that this opportunity is not lost, the physician should make sure not to overemphasize one solution over another and thereby lose the interest of the patient.  \n",
      "The stages of readiness-to-change model, which is the central construct in the transtheoretical model as outlined by Prochaska and Velicher [46], can be used to identify the stage that a patient is in.

The patient-centeredness aim is particularly salient to the issue of obesity because it has been observed that gaps remain in the way in which physicians and other clinicians provide medical care services to obese patients. As defined by the Institute of Medicine [48], patient centeredness relates to providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.  \n",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [49], approximately 29% of men and 44% of women are trying to lose weight. Furthermore, among men who consider themselves to be overweight or obese, 36 and 60% are trying to lose weight, respectively. Among women who consider themselves to be overweight or obese, 60 and 70% are trying to lose weight. Even among those who consider themselves to be at a weight that is about right for them. 7% of men and 27% of women are trying to lose weight. Although the combination of diet and physical activity is the preferred method for weight loss, most attempt to lose weight by diet alone, fewer by physical activity alone, and even fewer use the combination.  \n",
      "Patients tend to value the interaction with their physician highly; often they view their primary care physician as a \"trusted guide.\" However, in the context of addressing obesity, the studies appear to be equivocal. Overweight patients were significantly less satisfied with the care that they received for obesity and with the physician's expertise in this area compared to the care that they received in the areas of their general health or medical needs, as well as their physician's expertise in these other areas of medicine and health [50]. Among the reasons cited, 50% of patients reported that their physician had not mentioned any of ten common weight loss methods; 65% of patients reported a lack of understanding on the physician's part about the difficulty of being overweight; and about 35% indicated that the doctor did not believe them when they talked about their food consumption. More worrisome findings included the reporting of overweight and obese patients' feelings that they were treated with disrespect by their health care providers based on their weight status [51].  \n",
      "On the other hand, patients also report the importance of feeling that their physician helps them in achieving their weight-related goals. Dietary advice, help in setting realistic goals, and exercise recommendations are among the most appreciated reasons for advice [52]. Yet, the denial of a patient's weight problem or the avoidance of addressing the issue of obesity by the physician is not appreciated by the patient at all. Patients want to discuss their obesity-related issues with their physician and would like more rather than less physician involvement; however, almost two-thirds of patients report that their physician did not bring up the subject at their last visit [52].  \n",
      "It is clear that the patient wants to be supported by the primary care physician in attempts to address concerns about excess weight. However, it appears that, in general, advice is often lacking and the approach taken to address weight-related issues may not be the most empathetic or respectful in some cases. A more thoughtful and systematic method of including this topic in the arsenal of clinical tools and strategies for dealing with patient care may be needed.\n",

      "Document 489:\n",
      "Despite best intentions, the integration of counseling for diet, physical activity, and excess weight into clinical care is below par. The reality of busy clinic schedules, limited time for a physician to spend time with the patient, the issue of financial reimbursement, and other reasons result in missed opportunities to talk to patients about taking action on these modifiable adverse health risks [53,54]. It is also unlikely that physicians will ever have more time to devote to counseling for health behaviors due to the high cost of physician time and the time pressures under which they do their work [53].  \n",
      "Therefore, a promising approach is to consider how best to extend the reach of the primary care physician into an extended care team that is inclusive of nurses, but also dietitians, exercise physiologists, health educators, and behavior change counselors. This approach would require an office-based system that may be viewed as a recognizable organized process supporting the systematic delivery of counseling and interventions that address obesity, nutrition, and physical activity [54]. Such systems should not be limited to the clinics, but extend beyond the clinic walls and employ multiple technologies, including mail, telephone, and Web-based solutions [55].\n",

      "Document 490:\n",
      "Creating a system, or organized process, around the provision of effective obesity care that operates efficiently on a day-to-day basis is extremely important. Such a system should be integrated and be designed around a patient care team that places the patient's needs at the core of its work. Because teamwork needs coordination, delegation of tasks, and ongoing feedback, key steps and referrals and hand-offs need to be delineated and systematized so that they may be documented, tracked, and monitored to allow for continuous improvement. Starfield [56] defines a patient care team as \"a group of diverse clinicians who communicate with each other regularly about the care of a defined group of patients and participate in that care.\" Such teams ensure that all elements of care are performed competently [57].  \n",
      "The optimal team composition is also important to consider and will certainly vary among practices. The physician should be positioned as the team leader and source of the common philosophy of care [58] based on the notion that critical success factors include physician commitment and leadership and a supportive organizational structure [59]. Prior to patient-physician clinical interaction, however, support staff plays a role in meeting and greeting the patient and setting the tone for the visit. Registered nurses review the patient chart and obtain vital signs that should include height and weight measurement. In a paper-based practice, height and weight can be converted easily into BMI with the use of BMI charts; in practices that employ electronic medical records, the BMI can be calculated immediately as preprogrammed into the computer applications. Alternatively, BMI information may be already available if the patient had a chance to complete a more in-depth assessment of health risks behaviors such as a health risk appraisal. The nurse may also include additional measurements, such as the waist circumference.  \n",
      "Armed with this information, which completes the first of the 5As, the physician has a chance to initiate a dialogue with the patient, provide advice, and gain agreement for action. In a typical, busy clinic schedule, the physician has approximately 1 minute available to address preventionrelated topics [60]; thus, a referral to another member of the extended care team should be made to do the \"assist\" and \"arrange\" for follow-up. This referral may be made to a clinical registered dietitian or to a centralized service that provides the counseling needed to support behavior changes. The health professionals in such a centralized program include registered dietitians, health educators, counseling psychologists, pharmacists, and exercise physiologists. Few examples of such systems are available in the literature, although some are emerging [61].\n",

Integration of documentation of the patient data, referrals, action steps taken, program participation, results and outcomes, and evaluation data, and the tracking of such data in robust databases can create efficient office-based systems. To do this effectively, systems designs should optimize the use of interactive technologies. Interactive technology approaches have great potential to enhance primary care behavior change counseling and support [62-64]. Computer-based strategies can help clinicians to \"systematize\" repetitive aspects of practice, such as repeated assessments and identification of individual goals. In addition, they can help avoid systematic errors in the process by consistently following a predetermined pathway of actions. Such approaches can be integrated into the visit process and result in more consistent implementation of the 5As.\n",

      "Document 492:\n",
      "A combination of clinic-based resources and the use of an extended care team that includes resources available for \"between visit care\" may well be an optimal form of treatment design because most of the behavior changes will happen outside the clinic walls. Figure 32.2 depicts a protocol that combines the in-clinic \"assess.\" \"advise\", and \"agree\" steps of the 5As with the \"assist\" and \"arrange\" steps that may be provided by an extended care team. This team includes allied health professionals associated with the clinic and the physician but located in a centralized department, such as a health plan health education department or a contracted vendor arrangement. The clinic personnel, including the nursing staff and the physicians, stay connected with the behavior change staff using interactive technology such as a secure Website, telephone, and fax. The use of a Website is of interest because physicians and their nursing team can be provided access to a portion of the site specific to their patient only. At the time of the next visit, the patient's records can be reviewed and advice can be tailored to progress in the treatment program.  \n",
      "This type of approach is used by the National Center for Lifestyle Management (NCLM) project as implemented by the Health Partners Health Behavior Group [45]. This project utilizes a secure Website (www.nclm.us) that houses a physician-training program and referral and documentation information for patients referred to a telephone-based intervention for weight management that has a walking program integrated in its curriculum. The training module presents an overview of the problem of obesity in the U.S. that also provides Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit when completed. In addition, clinical staff can use the Website to refer patients into the phone course.  \n",
      "The physician or nurse enters key information into the Website that allows the centralized NCLM staff to contact the patient proactively. Once the staff member connects by phone with the patient, a choice is available to enroll in the program or — based upon more detailed information regarding learning style and other interests - a match can be made to an available communitybased resource that has previously been identified by clinic staff. Because the referrals are made following the \"agree\" step in the 5As process, the enrollment rate into the phone-based program is relatively high based upon early results of the project - i.e., over 70% of referred patients enroll in the program. In addition, the average weight of the referred patients is relatively high, i.e., a BMI over 35 kg/m².  \n",
      "Once the patient enrolls in the program, periodic calls averaging ~15 minutes in length connect him or her to the behavior change counselors. The course consists of ten lessons that are typically completed in approximately 6 months. Average weight loss associated with this program is ~6 kg at 6 months [65].  \n",
      "On an ongoing basis, counselors document patient progress into the Website in a format that allows the physician to review this information by patient or by his or her panel of referred patients. Thus, following a referral into this program, when a patient is scheduled for a follow-up clinic visit, the updated information on progress can be reviewed prior to the visit and included in the chart so that reinforcement can be provided based on current and accurate data.\n",

      "In this protocol, a clinical care delivery team (physician, nurse, clinical dietitian, and receptionist) extend their reach by collaborating with more centralized functions provided by allied health personnel (health educator, exercise physiologist, pharmacist, and dietitian). Together, this extended care team can support the patient during the clinic visit and during the time between two visits.  \n",
      "Note: Protocol based on NHLBI Clinical Guidelines (20) and the National Center for Lifestyle Management Project (45); Hx = history; BMI = body mass index: Ht = height: wt = weight: RD = registered dietitian: CDE = certified diabetes educator: HE = health educator: Ex Phys = exercise physiologist; Couns Psych = counseling psychologist; Rx = pharmacist; PA = physical activity; RTC = readiness to change; Pt = patient  \n",
      "FIGURE 32.2 A protocol to integrate \"in-clinic\" and \"between-clinic\" visits. (Adapted from HealthPartners, Center for Health Promotion, 2004 [68].)  \n",
      "Ongoing motivation and monitoring of clinical outcomes can be provided during the clinic visits. On the other hand, behavior change and ongoing health education can be provided during the time between the visits. This approach efficiently and effectively integrates exercise and diet recommendations into busy primary care practice settings without overburdening the primary care providers.\n",

      "Motivating people to exercise is one of the greatest challenges in helping people adopt physical activity. The threat of cancer is life-shaking enough that most patients are willing to try anything to recover more quickly or improve their odds of survival, even if that includes beginning an exercise program. Exercise is reported as the most frequently used (21%) alternative therapy for management of diseases. I Although a diagnosis of cancer may be a trigger to increase physical activity, numerous barriers can lead to noncompliance.\n",

      "Because exercise is a voluntary activity, people often lose their motivation when faced with the challenges of lack of time, demands by family and work, and even the discomfort of exercise when a program progresses too quickly or a participant is pushed, or pushes himself or herself, beyond capacity. People begin and maintain an exercise program if the outcomes of their physical activity efforts are valued, and to many cancer patients, the outcomes of improved quality of life, and physical and emotional well-being are sufficient to persist in an exercise program.  \n",
      "Three key concepts are related to adherence: (1) the activity must be meaningful; (2) the benefits need to be connected to the survivor's personal goals (e.g., maintain mobility); and (3) the goals need to be realistic so that results can be seen in a step-by-step fashion.2 Outcome expectancies for each survivor need to be consistent, reasonable, and systematically set up to guide the individual toward his or her desired goals. A survivor may not have been physically active in many years or may actually be averse to physical activity. Self-confidence and belief in their ability to complete the exercise and achieve their goals successfully must be considered when developing physical activity programs for cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors who were successful in adhering to a 6-month strength and weight training program used self-efficacy to stay motivated and comply with the program.3  \n",
      "Part of promoting an individual's confidence and self-efficacy to exercise is to help in understanding what must be done to attain desired goals. If beliefs and behaviors are consistent with the exercise program, the individual will be moving in the direction of goal attainment. Cancer patients and survivors appear to have different beliefs about the benefits of exercise and may be motivated to exercise for difference reasons.4 Exercise programs that build confidence and slowly increase the level of intensity appear to be most appealing to survivors.5  \n",
      "Social influences can impede or enhance a patient's decision to participate in an exercise program and continue with it in the long run.6 The beliefs and attitudes of family and friends, work colleagues and health care professionals, as well as the subtle persuasion of the media, all influence a person's interest and willingness to exercise. Social influence is powerful and can have negative outcomes. Cancer survivors have reported that well-meaning family and friends discouraged them from exercise and that health care professionals did not support their decisions to exercise. 19 These negative factors affect how well a patient will adhere to physical activity. Conversely, survivors who report positive interactions with family, friends, colleagues, and health care providers are more likely to begin an exercise program and adhere to it in the long term.8  \n",
      "An awareness of the value of physical activity for cancer survivors is growing rapidly in the lay community and numbers of exercise groups and hospital-based programs for survivors are growing. Team Survivor is a national program to promote physical activity among women with a diagnosis of cancer. This program helps women, many of whom have never been physically active, to begin to exercise. The supportive environment of exercising with other cancer survivors provides a positive social influence and reinforcement to exercise.  \n",
      "Patients who are having a difficult time adhering to an exercise program need special attention. A discussion with the patient about conflicts and barriers can be enormously helpful in developing an appropriate exercise prescription and assisting the individual in building strategies to overcome barriers. A study testing the theory of planned behavior observed that intention to exercise among breast and prostate cancer survivors was influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.10 Another study of breast cancer survivors training for dragon boat racing also supported the theory of planned behavior, demonstrating that intention determined adherence to the program.  \n",
      "Although most cancer survivors use exercise as a way to feel in control, feel better, look better and improve their health, the age of a patient may have some bearing on choice of exercise.11 Patients in their 20s or younger may be more motivated to improve their looks and physique, and want to feel strong and healthy again, whereas patients in their 30s, 40s, and 50s may choose to exercise so that they can maintain their ability to work, raise their family, and ward off some of the effects of aging. Patients over 60 years old often elect to exercise to maintain their physical strength and independence and slow the aging process. Older patients who are retired tend to have more time to devote to exercise, and this population is often willing and excited about joining an exercise program or adding specific exercises tailored to their daily regimen and particular needs.8 Conversely, older patients may have significant comorbidities that limit their exercise capacity.\n",

      "One's approach to the cancer patient is important.13,13 The majority of survivors (85%) report that they would prefer to meet in person to receive exercise counseling, and 77% preferred that information about exercise be provided by an exercise specialist associated with a cancer center, indicating a strong desire for trustworthy and professional information.5 Maintaining a patient's privacy and confidentiality is imperative to developing a trusting relationship in which the patient feels comfortable asking potentially sensitive questions.  \n",
      "Information to review with patients includes their health history, exercise history, and results from fitness evaluations. Regular meetings to review individual progress can increase a survivor's motivation and interest and provide time for the individual to discuss any challenges experienced with the exercise prescription, social pressures, or personal concerns. The exercise leader who can project sensitivity, concern, and trust while imparting information about an exercise prescription developed in collaboration with the survivor will help him or her feel comfortable and informed and may even increase satisfaction and encourage greater compliance with the program.\n",

      "Document 499:\n",
      "A challenge confronting the professional developing an exercise prescription is individualizing it to the patient.14 In the cancer setting, this concept is further complicated by the myriad side effects that patients may experience during cancer treatments and the long-term side effects that may influence mobility, strength, balance, cardiac and pulmonary function, and tactile sensations. Considering the acute and chronic side effects of therapy when organizing a group exercise program presents additional challenges. A collaborative relationship with the patient's health care team can mitigate the risks of prescribing exercise to individuals with complex medical backgrounds and possibly other comorbid conditions, which may further affect their ability to exercise.  \n",
      "Inherent in developing an exercise prescription for patients is determining the appropriate activities. Survivors are more likely to comply with an exercise program over time if they participate in activities that they enjoy. At this point in time, it is not known whether aerobic is superior to resistance exercise, or vice versa; therefore, it is unwise to guide a patient in one direction or another. The ideal exercise program may prove to be a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise to help patients maintain and improve their cardiopulmonary function while strengthening muscles that may have been disrupted from surgery or need strengthening to improve balance and ambulation.  \n",
      "Providing specific individualized guidelines for target heart rate ranges during aerobic exercise helps patients stay within a reasonable exercise intensity so that physical activity is fun and challenging, rather than aversive. However, when patients are receiving chemotherapy or other treatments, it is more difficult to prescribe exercise using heart rate because anemia and fluid shifts can dramatically influence heart rates. Starting patients very slowly and even breaking exercise sessions into different times of the day may be important to help them succeed without getting overly tired. Patients who keep records or logs of their exercise can see their progress, which is motivating. Logs help patients see gradual increments of improvement. They can chart the increase in duration and intensity of exercise.  \n",
      "One of the hardest concepts for patients, whether previous exercisers or not, is that they must start slowly and build an aerobic base. As people age, it takes longer to build this base and the process of physiological adaptation needs to be given about 40% more time.15 The slow rate of progress is difficult for people who want to see instant results or who think that they should be able to exercise the way that they did when they were 20 years old. Jones' 2002 survey of cancer survivors' preferences observed that survivors prefer to exercise at a moderate intensity; this must be taken into consideration when developing exercise programs. Most survivors prefer to walk and engage in other moderate-intensity exercises.5,16  \n",
      "Another approach to monitoring exercise intensity is using subjective measures of effort. Scales, such as Borg's Perceived Exertion Scale, can help patients to monitor their efforts. However, using subjective measures has its limits, especially among patients new to exercise. Individuals who are just beginning to exercise may find themselves focusing more on the scale and how they feel then on the exercise. Focusing on physical sensations and symptoms leads to increased perceived work intensity relative to actual workload and may result in individuals working at too low an intensity.17\n",

      "Making exercise meaningful is key to promoting a patient's commitment to and enthusiasm for exercise. It is critical to establish, with the patient, positive outcomes that are individualized, specific, realistic, and objective. When working with survivors, it is important to catch their attention and  \n",
      "make them aware of the significance of the changes that will occur with exercise. Work to help the individual fit exercise into his or her life and select activities that are appropriate and ideally linked to other interests.  \n",
      "Teach survivors to counter negative beliefs and self-talk about exercise by helping them to redirect their thinking in a more positive and constructive direction. That is, instead of thinking that exercise takes too much time, think that exercise provides more energy and strength to do important activities. Pinto et al. observed that overweight and obese breast cancer survivors were more likely to have low self-efficacy than their nonoverweight peers regarding their ability to succeed with exercise.18 These patients may need individualized interventions to increase their selfefficacy and refocus their negative self-talk. Finally, educate patients about the negative consequences of not exercising - focusing on what an important role exercise has in combating the debilitating effects of inactivity and how exercise will keep them strong enough to play with their grandchildren or continue working or pursuing goals.  \n",
      "A common precursor to noncompliance is lack of social support. Help survivors identify positive and negative sources of support and plan ways to build support from people who are positive and encouraging. Assist the individual in developing strategies to manage negative support and prevent problems before they occur. Organize exercise sessions so that family and friends can join in. Suggest that individuals use exercise time to walk the dog or spend quality time with children or friends. Help the survivor identify where he or she would prefer to exercise and with whom. Survivors have diverse and different needs and preferences, with 44% choosing to exercise alone and 40% favoring exercise programs performed at home.5  \n",
      "Breast cancer survivors participating in dragon boat racing reported that support from their physician, spouse, and friends was key to their success, as was the belief and confidence that they could attend the program given the time constrains of daily life, fatigue, and other health problems.19 Determinants of exercise for survivors of colon cancer were also intention and perceived control.20 This study observed that colon cancer survivors' beliefs about the benefits of exercise are substantially different from those of their healthy counterparts. Survivors reported exercising to improve well-being, gain control over cancer and life, improve recovery, help cope with stress of treatment and disease, and get their mind off their disease.  \n",
      "Establishing a step-by-step approach that leads the individual toward a regular exercise program can help those who are hesitant and unsure about starting an exercise program. This three-phase approach, called shaping,21 (1) helps the patient build confidence; (2) ensures that the patient paces activities to stay within the comfort zone; and (3) avoids overexertion and getting sore or injured and provides a personalized exercise program. Behavioral contracting is another approach to motivating exercise adherence. The contract to exercise must clearly spell out the objectives, the timeframe, and any consequences of failing to uphold the agreement.22 Contracting works best when it is made between two people because then it becomes a formal commitment and there is an obligation to fulfill the agreement in the contract.\n",

      "Goal setting is an effective motivator if it is individualized, manageable, and directed toward the ultimate goals of the survivor. Well-developed goals point the survivor in a positive direction and minimize disappointment and discouragement. Short-term goals that move the individual toward the long-term goal are optimal in promoting success because the survivor can see that goals are being achieved, step by step. Although long-term adherence to exercise programs appears to be more strongly influenced by survivor's perceived success rather than actual objective success, the exercise professional's responsibility is to guide the patient in selecting reasonable, realistic, and attainable goals.  \n",
      "Success with goal setting is connected to providing positive and constructive feedback. For feedback to be useful, it must be specific to the individual's goals, objective, and provided on a regular basis or formal schedule. Providing feedback based on objective measures is most helpful and can help survivors to identify even modest gains. Feedback on a 6- or 12-week basis is most helpful. The individual knows when to expect it and can use the information for motivation and reinforcement of the new lifestyle. Reiterate to the individual that the goals may need to be modified and revised at various times depending on progress, toleration of the exercise regimen, unanticipated changes in the treatment plan, and unexpected life events. Goal setting needs to be viewed as a fluid means to an end. For inactive survivors, providing reassurance that exercise is safe and educating them to understand the many benefits of exercise may help with exercise initiation and long-term adherence.\n",

      "It is a challenge to determine adherence rates in research on exercise in cancer patients and survivors because these studies vary in duration of the intervention, measures of adherence, and type of exercise program. Adherence rates were included in 12 studies; however, the methods of reporting the data varied. Adherence rates were reported by percentage of total subjects (ranging from 61 to 100% adhering) to percentage of attendance per subject (ranging from 72 to 98% adherence) to percentage of total training in exercise group (66 to 89% adherence).16,19,23-32 Although the research on adherence rate is limited, it is clear that cancer survivors exercise at a higher adherence rate than their healthy counterparts.\n",

      "Until relatively recently, exercise programs for cancer patients were not sought by patients or recommended by physicians. A growing body of research has established that, in fact, exercise may be an important component of an overall treatment plan for survivors. Promoting physical activity in the cancer setting is based on meeting the survivor's immediate and long-term goals. Developing a reasonable, realistic, and individualized program that is of a moderate intensity and not unduly physically challenging is important. It may be beneficial to help survivors identify ways to make exercise more pleasurable - whether that is to have music in the background, participate in an activity that they like, or exercise with friends and family. Although the body of research in cancer and exercise is growing, more work is needed to determine factors related to promoting exercise for survivors during and following cancer treatment.\n",

      "The preponderance of reports indicates that obese women have a worse prognosis following a breast cancer diagnosis compared to nonobese women.1 However, the area has remained controversial because of contradictory results from studies relying on relatively small patient samples.2-3 Most recently, a number of recent reports involving larger patient populations, which control for more potential confounding factors, have provided additional information regarding this question.4\n",

      "In a study of 5204 Nurses Health Study (NHS) participants diagnosed with invasive localized breast cancer in which 860 total deaths and 681 recurrences were seen, clinical outcomes were related to body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis.5 In a multivariate-adjusted analysis, weight at baseline was associated with increased risk for breast cancer recurrence and death, but these associations were seen only in participants who had never smoked. In addition, among those who had never smoked, breast cancer patients who gained weight after diagnosis had a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer death (p = 0.03). In this report, detailed information regarding systemic therapy received was not available. This report identified a negative prognostic role for obesity in women with resected breast cancer and suggested an interaction with smoking as well. In this regard, smoking has been previously associated with breast cancer incidence6 and lung metastases from breast cancer.7,8  \n",
      "In a report from Fox Chase Cancer Center, clinical outcome from 2010 patients diagnosed with stages I to II breast cancer were determined and related to BMI categories. At diagnosis, 22% of the patients were normal weight, 43% were overweight, and 35% were obese. The three weight groups showed no differences in terms of tumor size or lymph-node involvement, providing control for an important prognostic variable. The 5-year rates of distant metastases were 7% for patients with normal weight, 6% for overweight women, and 10% for obese individuals. Similarly, 5-year survival rates were lower in obese women compared to other groups (88 vs. 92%, respectively).  \n",
      "Enger and colleagues reported on body weight correlates with risk of breast cancer death in a population of 1376 breast cancer patients with stages I to II disease seen at one medical center.10 After 6.8 years of follow-up, 240 patients had died from breast cancer. A dose-response was seen; increasing weight also increased the likelihood of dying of breast cancer with a twofold increased risk when the lowest category of weight was compared to the highest category (hazard ratio [HR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 6.00; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, women in the upper 50th percentile of weight with estrogen receptor (ER) negative cancers were at nearly a fivefold increase mortality risk (HR 4.99, 95% CI, 2.17 to 11.48; P for interaction = 0.10) compared with women in the lower 50th percentile for weight with receptor-positive tumors. In this report influence on breast cancer recurrence was not provided.  \n",
      "In a cohort of 512 women reported by Goodwin and Colleagues, 11 a J-shaped relationship between body weight and breast cancer prognosis was described. In this group of early stage breast cancer patients, women with low or high BMI (<20 (low) or >25 (high) kg/m2) had the worst outcome. These more recent reports in larger populations suggest a role of higher body weight in adversely influencing prognosis. Questions raised by the exploratory analyses performed regarding a role for smoking and receptor status, as well as lower weight extremes in this process, remain unanswered. Also, methodology differences preclude direct comparison of these reports.\n",

      "Most recently, the relationship between obesity and early stage breast cancer outcome has been addressed in analyses from randomized adjuvant breast cancer therapy trials performed by multicenter, cooperative clinical trial groups. The associations among obesity, tamoxifen use, and clinical outcomes in estrogen receptor positive early stage breast cancer have been examined in a cohort of 3385 women in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) BP-14 - a randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to placebo. With long-term follow-up exceeding 166 months, breast cancer recurrence, contralateral breast cancers, and overall survival were compared in women who were obese (BMI > 30) at diagnosis compared to normal weight women at diagnosis (BMI < 25).12  \n",
      "The presence or absence of obesity had no effect on tamoxifen efficacy because reduced recurrence risk and increased survival were seen with tamoxifen regardless of BMI. In this population of receptor-positive patients, breast cancer recurrence was not influenced by obesity (HR 95% CI, 0.98, 0.80 to 1.18 for obese vs. not obese). However, contralateral breast cancer risk and all-cause mortality were significantly greater in women diagnosed when they were obese (for contralateral breast cancer, HR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.25 and for all-cause mortality, HR 1.31, 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.54). Thus, although obesity had no effect on recurrence risk in this population, overall mortality was significantly greater for obese breast cancer patients compared with those with normal weight.  \n",
      "Quite similar results have been reported from an analysis conducted by the International Breast Cancer Study Group of their trials.13 This group evaluated outcome of 6792 pre- and postmenopausal patients randomized to International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials and related outcome to BMI, which was categorized as normal (<25), intermediate (25 to 29.9), or obese (≥30). In these analyses, eight other conventional prognostic factors incorporating tumor stage and characteristics were also considered. In studies involving chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, patients with normal BMI had significantly longer overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with intermediate or obese BMI. However, when adjusted for other prognostic factors, higher BMI was associated with decreased overall survival (p = 0.03), but not decreased disease-free survival (p = 0.12).  \n",
      "These two retrospective analyses of outcome in randomized cooperative group clinical trials have considerable strengths - namely, carefully defined information on tumor stage, systemic therapy delivered, and cancer outcomes. However, it is not clear how protocol eligibility requirements may have excluded individuals with extremes of weight indirectly through comorbidity exclusions. In any event, taken together (see Table 34.1), these data suggest that body weight represents an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patient survival. These cooperative reports do not exclude a potential influence of obesity or related factors on breast cancer recurrence outcome, given the limitation of their retrospective design and protocol entry requirements.\n",

      "Delay in breast cancer recurrence is important; however, improved survival and quality of life are among the major objectives of therapies provided for early stage breast cancer patients. The observed statistically significant adverse influence of obesity on overall survival and non-breast cancerrelated survival in these clinical trials - initiated decades ago in some cases - will be of increasing importance in determining outcome of currently diagnosed breast cancer patients.14 Currently, the more widespread use of mammography is diagnosing patients at an earlier stage and therapeutic improvements related to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are substantially reducing a woman's risk of death related to breast cancer recurrence. Therefore, appropriate management of obesity in breast cancer patients will become a major factor in determining clinical outcome of women with resected early stage breast cancer. 15,16\n",

Although insulin was significantly correlated with BMI, insulin remained an independent predictor for adverse clinical outcome.11 Estrogen levels were not correlated with recurrence risk or mortality risk in these pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients.  \n",
      "Recently, Borugian and colleagues have reported similar findings from a British Columbia Tumor Registry cohort of 603 early stage breast cancer patients in which 112 deaths have occurred.17 Using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Model, they reported a statistically significant correlation with high insulin tertile and increased mortality risk in postmenopausal breast cancer patients (relative risk [RR] 1.9, 95% CI, 0.7 to 6.6). In this regard, the previously mentioned report by Enger and colleagues, which found that obesity was most strongly related to mortality in women with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancers, suggests that factors other than estrogen may mediate the effect.10 In addition, cross-sectional analyses in postmenopausal women without cancer suggest that low physical activity and high caloric intake are related to higher fasting insulin levels, suggesting a role for insulin in obesity-mediated change in breast cancer outcome.18 Although obesity has been linked to higher estrogen levels as potential mediator of its adverse influence on breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women, 9 a role for obesity-induced estrogen increase has not been linked to breast cancer recurrence risk.  \n",
      "Women who are obese are more likely to have higher caloric and dietary fat intakes and be less physically active compared to leaner women. These factors of increased energy intake, increased dietary fat intake, and reduced physical activity have been correlated with risk of at least breast cancer incidence in some reports.20-22 More recently, several of these lifestyle factors have been related to recurrence risk as well. In a cohort of a 122,000 women for the Nurses' Health Study with 2100 breast cancers and 209 deaths from cancer, the risk of breast cancer death was significantly less in women with more physical activity.28 Walking 1 hour at 3 miles per hour expends 3 MET-hours.

      "Consideration of breast cancer outcomes in African American women has raised issues regarding the potential role of obesity - particularly in this population. Although age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer is lower in African American compared that of white women, African American women have higher breast cancer mortality,20 a phenomenon that has been largely unexplained.25,26  \n",
      "We have recently explored this issue in the 156,570 postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative.27  \n",
      "Following collection of breast cancer risk factors, women were prospectively followed for breast cancer incidence, breast cancer characteristics, and breast cancer mortality. Adjustment for multiple breast cancer risk factors accounted for differences in breast cancer incidence in all minorities except for African Americans, in whom the HR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.92 continued to indicate a lower breast cancer incidence risk. African American women were nearly twice as likely to be obese (BMI ≥ 30; seen in 51% of African Americans compared to 28% of whites, p = 0.001) and breast cancers in African Americans had unfavorable characteristics; 32% of those in African Americans but only 10% in white women were high-grade and estrogen receptor-negative (adjusted odds ratio 4.70; 95% CI, 3.12 to 7.09).  \n",
      "To examine the relative contribution of ethnicity/race and obesity to these results, multinomial logistic regression models of the influence on breast cancer histology of age, BMI, menopausal hormone therapy use, socioeconomic factors, and ethnicity/race were performed. In these models, BMI was only a modest nonstatistically significant (p = 0.10) predictor of the unfavorable highgrade, ER-negative cancers; ethnicity/race was highly correlated (p < 0.001) with this histology. In addition, after adjustment for prognostic factors, a higher mortality after breast cancer diagnosis was identified in African American compared to white women (HR 1.79, 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.05). Thus, comprehensive analyses suggest that factors other than obesity may contribute to the adverse outcome of African American women with breast cancer. Such findings suggest that detailed biologically based subgroup analyses may be needed to dissect relationships between obesity and breast cancer outcome correctly.\n",

Currently, no ongoing full-scale trials of weight loss or weight management in women with diagnosed breast cancer are being conducted. Because randomized trials and other patient populations have identified a strategy to achieve and maintain moderate weight loss that incorporates dietary counseling, increased physical activity, behavioral therapy, and ongoing medical suppression, 9 weight loss programs incorporating these elements could be recommended for evaluation in obese breast cancer patients. The status of lifestyle intervention strategies currently under evaluation in clinical trials involving breast cancer patients is outlined next.  \n",
      "Although full-scale outcome studies of weight loss in women with breast cancer have not been conducted, several small randomized trials support the feasibility of weight loss intervention in this population.31-34 With respect to exercise, moderately sized randomized trials suggest that increased physical activity can be achieved with favorable influence - at least on physical functioning parameters including fatigue symptoms. 35,36  \n",

      "The Women's Healthy Eating Lifestyle (WHEL) study has randomized over 3000 pre- and postmenopausal women with early stage resected breast cancer to a control condition vs. a program of dietary fat intake reduction plus fruits and vegetable increase. 40,41 The feasibility of this intervention has also been reported; however, substantial weight loss (not an intervention target) has not been seen.42 Clinical outcome results of this ongoing study are anticipated in the near future.\n",

      "While awaiting definite results from clinical trials, current clinical management can perhaps be best guided4s by the recently updated American Cancer Society guide for informed choice, nutrition, and physical activity during and after cancer treatment.44 These guidelines provide specific recommendations for exercise and nutrition for patients with breast cancer and can be used to make recommendations to patients in clinical practice. Women should attempt, at least, to maintain weight after breast cancer diagnosis. Weight gain after diagnosis is a common occurrence45 and clinicians should recommend that patients avoid or reverse this type of weight gain. If a patient is unable to achieve ideal body weight, it is postulated that 5 to 10% weight loss over 6 to 12 months may also have benefits, as seen in reduction of biomarkers associated with risk.44 Weight loss of 1 to 2 lb per week is considered safe for overweight women46,47 as long as it does not interfere with treatment.\n",

It is also recommended that individuals keep total fat intake between 20 to 35% of calories, with most fats coming from sources of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.

To reduce the risk of chronic disease in adulthood, these guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week. To help prevent unhealthy weight gain in adulthood, it is suggested to engage in approximately 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorousintensity activity on most days of the week without exceeding caloric intake. To sustain weight loss in adulthood, one should participate in at least 60 to 90 minutes of daily moderate-intensity activity without exceeding caloric intake. Activities recommended include cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility exercises, and resistance training.  \n",
      "Although few randomized clinical trials have been conducted, most studies suggest that exercise improves quality of life in patients with breast cancer during as well as after treatment. As mentioned, increased physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of primary breast cancer and new evidence suggests a reduction in recurrence risk in women with breast cancer.44 The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals adopt an active lifestyle and engage in physical activity at least 5 or more days per week possibly to reduce risk of primary breast cancer.440 This same principle may apply to women with diagnosed breast cancer, given the new evidence. Aerobic training may help with reducing or maintaining weight after diagnosis. 31,55,56\n",

      "Weight problems are common among breast cancer patients in the U.K. An estimated 64% of patients commencing endocrine therapy and 51% commencing adjuvant chemotherapy are overweight or obese. One third of patients experience sigmificant weight gain (>5 kg) over the course of adjuvant chemotherapy, and those receiving endocrine therapy also appear to experience gains in fat, particularly central fat. Weight gain is a major concern to patients. They often seek further information, advice, and support in their endeavors to control their weight. The ideal way of delivering weight management advice in this group is not resolved. It is likely that, for some patients, successful weight management would require a multidisciplinary team, including a dietitian and a specialist breast care nurse, with further psychological support available wherever appropriate. Low staffing levels within U.K. cancer centers mean that these services are not widely available. The use of slimming on referral, exercise on prescription, and pharmacotherapy in nonspecialist weight management services has increased. The relevance of these approaches to the management of patients with cancer needs to be investigated.\n",

The incidence of breast cancer has increased by 11% over the past decade. Age-standardized mortality rates from breast cancer over this time have been reduced dramatically. The annual breast cancer death rate per 100,000 women at ages 20 to 49, 50 to 69, and 70 to 79 decreased by 22, 22, and 12% respectively [1]. The increasing incidence and greater proportion of patients surviving breast cancer means that the population of cancer survivors in the U.K. is growing (Figure 35.1).

      "Excess weight at diagnosis has been linked to a poorer prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Much of this increased risk is thought to be linked to later detection and increased nodal involvement among heavier women. Based on 6792 women, the largest analysis to date found BMI to be an independent, albeit weak, prognostic factor predicting disease free and overall survival irrespective of tumor characteristics in the overall group [2]. The adverse effects of excess weight in this study, however, were mainly seen among pre- and perimenopausal women treated with chemotherapy without endocrine therapy. Relative risk (RR) of relapse in this group was 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.39) for obese women and 1.07 (0.97 to 1.18) for overweight women compared to normal weight women. Likewise RR of overall mortality over 10 years in this group was 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.43) for obesity and 1.10 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.23) for overweight compared to normal weight women [2].  \n",
      "Similarly a recent analysis among 3144 patients from the French Adjuvant Study Group (FASG) trial, found BMI to be an independent prognostic factor for relapse in patients receiving chemotherapy only or combined with tamoxifen [3]. Newman et al. found higher BMI to have a negative impact on survival among women who were estrogen receptor-positive and negative, suggesting weight may have an impact on survival via nonestrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms [4].  \n",
      "The effects of excess weight among postmenopausal women receiving endocrine therapy are not resolved. In the French Adjuvant Study Group analysis BMI did not have an impact on prognosis among women receiving tamoxifen alone [3]. In contrast, although the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project did not associate excess weight at diagnosis with increased rate of breast cancer recurrence among women receiving tamoxifen, risk of contralateral breast cancer was greater in obese (RR 1.58; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.25) and in overweight (RR 1.22 (0.87 to 1.71) compared to normal weight women. Noncancer deaths were also more likely among obese (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.92) and overweight (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92) compared to normal weight women [5].\n",

      "The amount of fat and lean tissue should ideally be assessed in breast cancer patients. Weight is a poor predictor of changes in body fat, particularly among patients receiving chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Bioelectrical impedance is increasingly used to assess body composition in weight management settings. Impedance is the resistance of the body to the flow of an alternating current. This technique is based on the fact that lean tissues have a high water and electrolyte content and are good conductors, whereas fat is a poor conductor. Impedance measurements are thus related to the volume of the conductor, which relates to total body water, fat-free mass, and fat mass. However, impedance does not appear to be a good predictor of changes in body fat among women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy [10] because they may have unpredictable changes in fluid and electrolyte distribution and the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fluid. A further limitation of impedance among women receiving adjuvant or endocrine therapy is that impedance is insensitive to measure changes in central fat stores [42].  \n",
      "In noncancer settings, focus has increasingly been on the importance of waist measurements rather than BMI as a marker of risk for weight-related comorbidity. Specifically, waist measurements predict aspects of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [43]. The avoidance of metabolic syndrome is relevant among breast cancer patients. This will reduce the likelihood of comorbidities such as heart diseases and diabetes. Aspects of the metabolic syndrome - i.e., insulin resistance [44] and a greater waist to hip ratio [45] - have been linked to a poorer prognosis.  \n",
      "Waist and hip circumferences should be measured alongside weight measurements among breast cancer patients. For non-Asian women, a waist circumference > 32 in. (80 cm) is considered to place women at an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, and a waist circumference > 35 in. (88 cm) places women at high risk of metabolic syndrome. For Asian women, a waist greater than 32 in. (80 cm) places women at high risk of metabolic syndrome. In our studies among early breast cancer patients, the proportion of women who had a \"high-risk\" waist measurement at 1 year from commencing adjuvant chemotherapy (70% of patients at 1 year compared to 40% at baseline) or adjuvant endocrine therapy (53% of patients at 1 year compared to 40% at baseline) increased significantly.\n",
